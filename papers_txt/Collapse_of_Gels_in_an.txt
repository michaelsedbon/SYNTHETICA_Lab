Collapse of Gels in an Electric Field
Abstract. An infinitesimal change in electric potential across a polyelectrolyte gel
produces a discrete, reversible volume change. The volume of the collapsed gel can
be several hundred times smaller than that of the swollen gel.
Partially hydrolyzed acrylamide gels
in a solvent, such as an acetone-water
mixture, undergo discrete and reversible
volume
transitions
upon
infinitesimal
changes in temperature, solvent compo-
sition, pH, or concentration of an added
salt (1, 2). The degree of volume change
varies with the degree of ionization of
the gel and may be as large as 500-fold.
The volume change is understood as a
phase transition of the system consisting
of the charged polymer network, coun-
terions, and fluid (3). The phase transi-
tion is a manifestation of competition
among three forces on the gel: the posi-
tive osmotic pressure of counterions, the
negative pressure due to polymer-poly-
mer affinity, and the rubber elasticity of
the polymer network (2). The balance of
these forces varies with changes in tem-
perature or solvent properties.
We demonstrate here that the phase
transition is also induced by the applica-
tion of an electric field across the gel.
The electric forces on the charged sites
of the network produce a stress gradient
along the electric field lines in the gel.
There exists a critical stress below which
the gel is swollen and above which the
gel collapses. The volume change at the
transition is either discrete or continu-
ous, depending on the degree of ioniza-
tion of the gel and on the solvent compo-
sition.
Fig. 1. (a) A cylindrical gel segment 3 cm long
is placed between platinum electrodes and
immersed in a 50 percent acetone-water mix-
ture. When an electric field is applied to the
gel, a stress gradient appears along the elec-
tric field. A portion of the gel having stress
larger than a critical value collapses while the
rest of the gel remains swollen. (b) The pro-
portion of collapsed to swollen regions in the
gel varies with the electric potential. (c) Pho-

gelled. After an hour, the gels were re-
moved from the micropipettes and im-
mersed in water to wash away residual
monomers. The gels then underwent hy-
drolysis
in a
1.2 percent solution of
TEMED (pH 12) for more than a month.
Approximately 20 percent of the acryl-
amide groups were converted to acrylic
acid groups, some of which were ionized

(In experiments where the composition
of the acetone-water mixture is varied,
the volume of these gels can change by a
factor of 300 with an infinitesimal change
in the solvent composition.) After hy-
drolysis, the gels were immersed in a 50
percent
acetone-water
mixture.
Once
equilibrium was reached, the gels were
cut into segments 3 cm long. The diame-
ter of each segment was approximately 4
mm.

trodes ranged from 0 to 5 V (Fig. 1, b and
c). The electric field produces not only a
force on the H+, causing a stationary
current in the gel, but also a force on the
negatively charged acrylic acid groups in
the polymer network, pulling the gel
toward the positive electrode. This latter
action creates a uniaxial stress along the
gel axis, maximum at the positive elec-
trode and minimum at the negative elec-
trode. The stress gradient deforms the
gel. The new shape is in equilibrium
within a day. For potentials less than 1
V, there is no drastic change in the gel
shape. At 1.25 V, 20 percent of the gel
adjacent to the positive electrode col-
lapses 200-fold in volume. The other 80
percent of the gel remains swollen. With
an increase in voltage, more of the gel
collapses. Above 2.15 V, the entire gel
collapses. This phenomenon is revers-
ible-when the electric field is removed,
the gel assumes the
original swollen
shape. If the 50 percent acetone-water
mixture is replaced by pure water, the
gel diameter changes coutinuously along
the gel axis when the electric field is
applied.
The phenomenon can be explained in
terms of a mean field theory, initially
formulated for gels by Flory and Huggins
(4, 5). Consider a network consisting of v
polymers with their ends cross-linked.
Each polymer consists of No freely joint-
ed segments, of which f segments are
ionized. When formed, the network is
cylindrical with length Lo, diameter Do,
and concentration 4)0 and is in the special
condition
of no
interaction
between
polymer segments. This special condi-
tion is taken as a reference state from
wbich expansion or contraction is mea-
sured. A uniform electric field E is ap-
plied along the gel axis. One end of the
gel is fixed to an electrode to avoid the
translational motion of the entire gel
along the electric field. Depending on the
direction of the electric field, the gel is
either compressed or stretched along its
axis as a result of the presence of a
charged site on the network. Consider a
thin disk- in the gel of thickness AZ0
before application of the electric field
and located at a distance Z from the free
end ofthe gel (Fig. 2). Under the effect of
E, the thickness changes to pAZO and the
diameter to aD0. The aim of this analysis
is to find the combinations (a,>) that
minimize the free energy F of the disk.
The free energy includes a term associat-
ed with the deformation of the gel Fg and
a term for the work done against the
electric field Fe,
F = Fg + Fe

This
analysis accounts for both the discrete
transition observed in a 50 percent ace-
tone-water mixture and the continuous
transition in pure water. The former cor-
responds to a low T value, whereas the
latter corresponds to a high T value.
Although only the

considered in describing the phase tran-
sition, other factors may play a role. The
effects of inhomogeneous distributions

tion within the gel and electrochemical

The discrete volume transition of the

Al-
though initial interest in this subject was
generated by the immunodeficiency ob-
served in protein-malnourished children,
it is now recognized that such individuals
suffer from a wide range of nutritional
deficiencies (2). Attention has thus be-
come focused on the role of specific
nutrients in immune responsiveness. In
particular, much has been learned about
the influence of dietary zinc on the main-
tenance of immunological function in
adult animals (3). Zinc deficiency has
been associated with impaired immune
responses, particularly those mediated
by T lymphocytes
(4), and has been
shown to influence the course of infec-
tious (5), neoplastic (6), and autoimmune
disease (7). Similar observations have
been made in humans
(8). However,
relatively little is known about the role of
zinc in the ontogeny of immunity. We
previously showed that when mice are
deprived of zinc during the suckling peri-
od, their ability to generate an effective

although not to the same degree as in the
mised (9). Indeed, mice only marginally
deficient
in
zinc show decreased
re-
sponses to mitogens and sheep red blood
cells (SRBC's) and highly altered serum
immunoglobutin profiles (10). We now
report that moderate deprivation of zinc
during prenatal life alone is also associat-
ed with a depressed plaque-forming cell
(PFC) response to SRBC inoculation and
with impaired developmenit of serum
immunoglobulins. In addition, these de-
fects in immunological function persist
into the second and third generations.
Pregnant young adult Swiss Webster
mice were fed a zinc-deficient diet or a
control diet ad libitum from day 7 of
gestation (the beginning of pregnancy
was designated day 0) to term. The bio-
tin-fortified,
egg white-based
diet
(7)
contained 5 ppm zinc and the control diet
100 ppm zinc. The choice of these di-
etary levels of zinc was based on our
previous
studies
in
BALB/c
and
N:NIH(S) mice (7,
9). Moderate defi-
ciency was defined
as a reduction in
serum zinc to levels 60 to 70 percent of
those in control mice (9). Because Zinc
deficiency is known to cause inanition
(10), which also may alter immune func-
tion (11), pair-fed controls were also
studied. During the period of zinc depri-
vation all the mice were maintained un-
der conditions designed to reduce extra-
neous zinc contamination
(7,
10). At
parturition,
litters were culled to five
pups and all dams and offspring were
returned to the control diet, which they
consumed until the end of the experi-
ment. The PFC response to SRBC's and
the concentration of immunoglobulin M
(IgM) in serum were assessed in some
offspring at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 6
months, of age; the retnainder of the
offspring were mated (brothers to sisters)
at 10 weeks of age to produce an F2
generation. Because a consequence of
zinc deprivation during pregnancy is im-
paired development of the mammary
gland and reduced
la6tational
ability
(12), pups from zinc-deprived dams were
cross-fostered to control dams and pups
from control dams were, cross-fostered
to zinc-deficient dams. The F2 and F3
offspring were culled to five pups and
studied at thq same ages as the F, off-
spring or bred at 10 weeks of age. All F1,
F2, and F3 mice were thus fed the control
diet throughout their lives. The only pe-
riod of zinc deprivation was during ges-
tation of the F1 offspring.
Overt signs of zinc deficiency, such as
alopecia and exfoliative dermatitis, were
not observed in the zinc-deptived dams;
nonetheless,
othet features
were ob-
served, sich as decreased food intake,
fewer and smaller offspring, and slightly
higher neonatal
mortality
rates
(13).
Analysis of maternAl plasma on day 17 of
gestation indicated that a significant de-
gree
of
zinc
deficiency
had
been
achieved, with the controls fed ad libi-
tum atid the pair-fed controls having zinc
concentrations of 106.4 and 109.7 ,ug per
100 ml of plasma, respectively, com-
pared to 58.0 F.g per 100 tnl in dams fed
the 5 ppm zinc diet. These zinc concen-
trations were not as low as those general-
ly seen
in animals fed a diet nearly
devoid of zinc (14), indicating that a
moderate deficiency was achieved. No
further differences were observed be-
tween plasma zinc levels in any groups at
any age. Thus, the postnatal effects of
zinc depletion during gestation were due
to a defect in development rather than to
a persistence of low plasma zinc.
The F1 offspring of zinc-deficient dams
had no detectable 1gM at 6 and 10 weeks
of age (Fig. iA). By 6 months of age,
significant amounts
of IgM
had
ap-
peared, buit the concentrations were still
below those of both control groups.
