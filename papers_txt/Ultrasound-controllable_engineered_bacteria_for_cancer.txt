Rapid advances in synthetic biology are driving the development of genetically engineered
microbes as therapeutic agents for a multitude of human diseases, including cancer. The
immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors, in particular, creates a favorable
niche for systemically administered bacteria to engraft and release therapeutic payloads.
However, such payloads can be harmful if released outside the tumor in healthy tissues
where the bacteria also engraft in smaller numbers. To address this limitation, we engineer
therapeutic bacteria to be controlled by focused ultrasound, a form of energy that can be
applied noninvasively to speciﬁc anatomical sites such as solid tumors. This control is pro-
vided by a temperature-actuated genetic state switch that produces lasting therapeutic
output in response to brieﬂy applied focused ultrasound hyperthermia. Using a combination
of rational design and high-throughput screening we optimize the switching circuits of
engineered cells and connect their activity to the release of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In
a clinically relevant cancer model, ultrasound-activated therapeutic microbes successfully
turn on in situ and induce a marked suppression of tumor growth. This technology provides a
critical tool for the spatiotemporal targeting of potent bacterial therapeutics in a variety of
biological and clinical scenarios.

ell therapies are rapidly emerging as an exciting and
effective class of technologies for cancer treatment1–3.
Among the cell types being investigated for therapy,
immune cells have excelled in the treatment of hematologic
malignancies. However, their use in solid tumors has been
hampered by their reduced ability to penetrate and function in
the tumor’s immunosuppressive environment, especially within
immune-privileged hypoxic cores4–6. Conversely, the reduced
immune activity of some tumor cores creates a favorable
microenvironment for the growth of certain bacteria, which can
reach the tumors after systemic administration7–9. Capitalizing
on their tumor-inﬁltrating properties, such bacteria can be
engineered to function as effective cellular therapies by secreting
therapeutic payloads to directly kill tumor cells or remodel the
microenvironment
to
stimulate
anti-tumor
immunity10–15.
However, the beneﬁts of microbial therapy are often counter-
balanced by safety concerns accompanying the systemic injection
of microbes into patients with limited control over their biodis-
tribution or activity1,16,17. This is especially important given the
well-documented engraftment of circulating bacteria into healthy
tissues such as the liver, spleen, and certain hypoxic stem cell
niches18–21. To avoid damaging healthy organs, it is crucial that
the therapeutic activity of microbes be targeted to tumors.
Among the available mechanisms to regulate microbial func-
tion, systemically administered chemical inducers20,22–26 are
convenient to apply but incapable of targeting a particular ana-
tomical site. Meanwhile, light-induced control elements provide
high spatiotemporal precision27–29, but are constrained by the
poor penetration of light into intact tissues30. Radiation-induced
promoters can be targeted by deeply penetrant energy. However,
ionizing radiation carries the risk of damage to host immune cells
and engineered microbial cells31. Alternatively, temperature-
based transcriptional regulators enable spatiotemporal control at
depth, since temperature can be elevated precisely within a well-
tolerated range32,33 in deep tissues using noninvasive methods
such as focused ultrasound (FUS)34–36.
Indeed, it was recently demonstrated that FUS can be used in
conjunction with temperature-dependent repressors to control
the expression of bacterial genes37. However, these repressors
operated in clinically irrelevant cloning strains of bacteria, had
non-therapeutic outputs, and produced only transient activation
unsuitable for tumor treatment, which typically requires weeks of
therapeutic activity10,11,22.
Here we describe the development of FUS-activated ther-
apeutic bacteria in which a brief thermal stimulus activates sus-
tained release of anti-cancer immunotherapy. We engineer these
cellular agents by adapting temperature-sensitive repressors to the
tumor-homing probiotic species E. coli Nissle 191710,38 and
designing gene circuits in which they control an integrase-based
state switch37,39 resulting in long-term therapy production. To
improve the safety and efﬁcacy of these cells, we screen random
and rationally designed libraries of gene circuit variants for
constructs with minimal baseline activity and maximal induction
upon thermal stimulation. We use the optimized gene circuits to
express immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-
L1. In a mouse cancer model, we show that the resulting engi-
neered microbes are reliably and chronically activated by a brief,
noninvasive FUS treatment after systemic administration to
release therapy and successfully suppress tumor growth.
Results
Characterizing thermal bioswitches in a therapeutically rele-
vant microbe. To develop a temperature-actuated therapeutic
circuit, we started with high-performance temperature-dependent
transcriptional repressors, which actuate transient gene expression
in response to small changes in temperature around 37 °C37.
Since genetic elements tend to behave differently across cell types
due to variations in protein expression and other aspects of the
intracellular environment40, we ﬁrst characterized the perfor-
mance of these repressors in our chosen therapeutic chassis: E.
coli Nissle 1917 (EcN). This bacterial strain is approved for
human probiotic use and is commonly employed in microbial
tumor therapy10,38. We selected three repressor candidates—
TlpA39, TcI, and TcI42—as our starting points due to their
desirable activation temperature thresholds of 39 °C, 38 °C, and
42 °C, respectively. In its natural host, Salmonella typhimurium,
TlpA is speculated to be responsible for the regulation of viru-
lence genes upon entry into a warm host organism41. Meanwhile,
TcI is a temperature-sensitive mutant of the bacteriophage
lambda protein “cI”42. In its native context, cI serves as a tran-
scriptional repressor that allows the bacteriophage lambda virus
to establish and maintain latency43.
To evaluate the performance of these candidates we designed
reporter constructs where they regulate the expression of a green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1a), transformed them into EcN
cells, and measured the corresponding cell density-normalized
ﬂuorescence intensity as a function of temperature between 33 °C
and 42 °C (Fig. 1b). This construct provided a tractable platform
for us to directly evaluate the inducibility of thermally responsive
repressors in EcN cells by measuring GFP ﬂuorescence. As we
were interested in using these bioswitches in vivo, we focused on
the fold-change between the mammalian physiological tempera-
ture (37 °C) and an elevated temperature that can be used to
trigger activation in vivo while minimizing thermal damage to
local tissues (42 °C) (Fig. 1c). Results from these experiments
indicated that TcI42 is the best candidate for integration into our
thermal switch since it exhibits strong induction at 42 °C while
maintaining low levels of baseline activity.
With TcI42 serving as the thermal transducer in our cells, we
next sought to determine the minimal heating duration and ideal
heating parameters required to achieve strong activation while
minimizing damage to cells. We stimulated cells carrying the
circuit described in Fig. 1a by elevating the temperature to 42 °C
for different durations and measured the corresponding ﬂuores-
cence intensity (Fig. 1d). The results indicated that a minimal
heating time of one hour is needed for robust activation. We
quantiﬁed the effect of this thermal dose on microbial cell viability
and simultaneously tested a pulsatile heating scheme that was
previously shown to enhance viability in mammalian cells44. For
the pulsatile heating scheme, the duty cycle was kept constant at
50% while alternating the temperature between 37 °C and 42 °C,
resulting in a total of one hour at 42 °C over a two-hour period,
with pulse duration varying between 1 and 60 min (Fig. 1e). As
hypothesized, cell viability decreased as the pulse duration
increased, while induction levels did not signiﬁcantly vary (Fig. 1f).
Based on these results, we selected a ﬁve-minute pulse duration for
subsequent applications, as this heating paradigm enhanced cell
viability while being readily achievable with a focused ultrasound
setup. Collectively, our experiments identiﬁed and characterized
TcI42 as an effective thermal transducer to control gene
expression in the therapeutically relevant EcN strain.
Constructing a thermally actuated state switch. On its own, the
TcI42 switch is not sufﬁcient for microbial cancer therapy. This
switch is transiently activated for the duration of heating, while
tumor therapy requires weeks to effectively suppress tumor
growth. Since daily FUS application over this period may be
undesirable in a clinical setting, we set out to engineer a gene
circuit that maintains a prolonged therapeutic response following
a single, brief thermal activation.

To enable stable thermal switching, we placed the expression of
Bxb1, a serine integrase, under the control of the pL/pR phage
lambda thermally inducible promoters, whose activity is regulated
by the TcI42 repressor (Fig. 2a). Serine integrases such as Bxb1
were initially discovered in bacteriophages as a class of enzymes
targeting DNA sequences known as attP and attB sites. In their
native context, these sites serve as a hub for the integration of
bacteriophage DNA into the genome of target cells45. However,
these sites can be repurposed to ﬂank an arbitrary DNA sequence
and mediate its inversion, resulting in a stable switching
functionality46. Our design combines the temperature sensitivity
of TcI42 with this permanent effector function of the Bxb1
integrase. At physiological temperatures of approximately 37 °C,
constitutive expression of the TcI42 repressor from the pLacI
promoter represses the expression of Bxb1. Upon thermal
stimulation, the release of TcI42 repression results in a burst of

Bxb1 expression. Thermally derepressed Bxb1 expression then

ﬂanking the P7 promoter, resulting in subsequent expression of
a ﬂuorescent reporter to monitor the state of the circuit and

Because
the attP

the inverted DNA sequence is not recognized by subsequent Bxb1

of its protein payloads even when the temperature stimulus is
terminated. The P7 promoter was chosen from a depository of
synthetic constitutive bacterial promoters47 due to its balance of
strongly driving the expression of a genetic payload without
creating excessive stress to the cell. To avoid unregulated
expression of Bxb1 we insulated the activity of the temperature-
activated promoter by inserting two strong terminators upstream
to block activity from other regions of the plasmid48.
The ideal performance of the circuit described above would
maintain low baseline activity at physiological temperature while
providing strong and lasting induction once thermally stimulated.
To achieve this performance, we tuned three key sequence
elements affecting Bxb1 translation and stability: the Bxb1
ribosomal binding sequence (RBS), start codon, and ssrA
degradation tag (Fig. 2b). The ssrA tag is a short peptide that
naturally gets added to the C terminus of proteins whose
translation has stalled. Proteins that carry this sequence as a
fusion are targeted for degradation by endogenous bacterial
proteases49. To efﬁciently identify the optimal versions of these
elements we performed a library screen that consisted of
randomized
6-bp
sequences
within
the
Bxb1
RBS,
two
Bxb1 start codon choices, and randomized terminal tripeptides
in the Bxb1 ssrA degradation tag50. Two start codons were tested
because the non-canonical start codon GUG can down-regulate
ribosomal efﬁciency, and the last three amino acids of the ssrA
degradation tag were randomized because they strongly modulate
the degradation rate of ssrA-tagged proteins49. A total landscape
of approximately 107 possible unique variants was sampled using
a high-throughput plate-replication assay (Fig. 2b). Agar plates
containing colonies of library members were ﬁrst replicated, and
then one plate was incubated at 37 °C to assess baseline
expression, while the other plate was stimulated at 42 °C for an
hour and then returned to 37 °C for the rest of the growth period.
The temperature-dependent ﬂuorescence of a representative
sampling of variants is shown in Fig. 2c. We selected a subset
of variants with low leak and high activation to quantify their
switching performance with a larger number of replicates
(Fig. 2d). Out of these candidates, we selected candidate #5 for
further optimization since it activated the largest percentage of
the cells upon stimulation, a metric that is important to ensure
strong therapeutic activity in vivo, while still retaining a
reasonable temperature-dependent fold change (Fig. 2d).
To reduce the baseline activity of candidate #5, we modiﬁed
two additional circuit components (Fig. 2e). The ﬁrst modiﬁca-
tion changed the origin of replication from the low-copy origin
pSC101 to the medium-copy origin p15A. The second modiﬁca-
tion explored the effect of inserting a temperature-sensitive
terminator upstream of the Bxb1 coding sequence. This family of
terminators
have
been
engineered
to
mimic
temperature-
modulated structures known as RNA thermometers that are
found in the 5’ untranslated region of microbial mRNAs and play
an important role in regulating microbial gene expression in
response to temperature changes51. In our circuit, we used this
terminator
to
introduce
a
temperature-sensitive
secondary
structure in the mRNA transcript that helps terminate protein
expression at low temperatures, adding to the control provided by
TcI42 to prevent leaky Bxb1 protein production at physiological
temperature52. At 42 °C, this terminator loses its secondary
structure and Bxb1 expression is unimpeded. We assessed the
performance of four constructs with either one or both of these
modiﬁcations (Fig. 2f).
Increasing the copy number of the plasmid and inserting the
terminator reduced baseline activation independently. When
combined together, these modiﬁcations resulted in signiﬁcantly
reduced leakage while maintaining a large fold-change in
activated cells upon induction. The resulting construct, obtained
through a combination of randomized and rational engineering,
displayed a more than 100-fold change in activity between 37 °C
and 42 °C.
Engineering cells for thermally actuated secretion of immu-
notherapy. To demonstrate the functionality of our optimized
thermally-actuated cells in a clinically relevant scenario, we
modiﬁed the output of their gene circuit to express an anti-tumor
therapeutic payload (Fig. 3a). We selected αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1
nanobodies, which block signaling through the CTLA-4 and PD-
L1 checkpoint receptor pathways, that are heavily implicated in
T-cell
silencing
within
immunosuppressive
solid
tumors.
Checkpoint inhibitors such as αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 have
emerged as a major class of cancer therapy, but their therapeutic
efﬁcacy is commonly accompanied by the risk of unintentionally
activating autoimmunity in bystander tissues when administered
systemically53,54. By combining the ability of FUS to target spe-
ciﬁc areas deep within tissues with the tumor inﬁltration, thermal
response and molecular speciﬁcity of our engineered cells, we
reasoned that we could target the activity of these potent
immunomodulators to tumors and thereby mitigate the risks of
systemic exposure.
αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 have been shown to produce antitumor
effects
when
released
by
tumor-injected
probiotics10.
We
hypothesized that local FUS-activated release of these proteins
in tumors from systemically administered engineered bacteria
would suppress tumor growth. To test this hypothesis, we fused
αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 to a PelB secretion tag to enhance their
extracellular release upon activation and cloned each construct in
place of the tetracycline cassette in our optimized switching
circuit. The pelB leader peptide, derived from the Erwinia
carotovora pelB gene, has been previously used to secrete proteins
from microbes22,55,56. In addition, to stabilize our plasmids for
long-term retention in vivo without antibiotic selection, we added
an Axe-Txe toxin-antitoxin stability domain, which ensures
retention of the plasmid in a cell population by eliminating cells
that lose it57,58. The Axe-Txe type II toxin anti-toxin system

Enterococcus faecium plasmid pRUM57.
The thermal switching functionality of our therapeutic circuits
closely resembled their non-therapeutic counterpart. The circuit
containing αCTLA-4 maintained a tight off-state at 37 °C while
exhibiting robust fold-changes upon induction at 42 °C and 43 °C
(Fig. 3b). Furthermore, upon tracking induced cells post-
induction we saw no evidence of mutational escape, suggesting
a tolerable level of burden59 (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To assess the secretion of therapeutic nanobodies upon
activation, we stimulated the cells for one hour at 37 °C, 42 °C
and 43 °C, then cultured them for one day at 37 °C and performed
a Western Blot to evaluate the levels of αCTLA-4 nanobodies
released in their media. This experiment demonstrated that
αCTLA-4 nanobodies are reliably secreted exclusively upon
stimulation at 42 °C and 43 °C (Fig. 3c). We could not detect
any secretion when the cells were incubated at 37 °C. Similar
characterization was performed for cells expressing αPD-L1.
Focused ultrasound activation elicits in vivo tumor suppres-
sion. To enable thermal control of engineered therapeutic
microbes in vivo we built a FUS stimulation setup providing
feedback-controlled pulsatile tumor heating (Fig. 4a), capturing the
key features of clinically available instruments60,61. We demon-
strated that our system is capable of toggling the temperature in the
tumor of a live animal between 37 °C and 43 °C every ﬁve minutes
(Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 4). We set the focal maximum tem-
perature inside the tumor at 43 °C to allow more of the mass to be
heated above 42 °C and ensure reliable activation within the con-
text of a mouse. While this could lead to some thermal damage, we
reasoned that such damage within the tumor is acceptable and
could synergize with the microbial immunotherapy62,63.
Using this in vivo setup, we tested our ability to locally activate
systemically administered therapeutic microbes inside tumors.
We seeded 5 × 106 A20 murine tumor cells in the right ﬂanks of
BALB/c mice (Fig. 4b). Once the tumors grew to approximately
100 mm3, we intravenously injected 108 EcN cells comprising a
1:1 mixture of cells engineered for thermally actuated αCTLA-4
or αPD-L1 secretion. This combination therapy was chosen
because it provides a stronger anti-tumor
effect compared to
either therapeutic output on its own10 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Injected microbes were given two days to engraft in tumors before
they were stimulated with FUS. After FUS activation, tumor
growth was monitored to assess therapeutic efﬁcacy.
We observed major retardation in tumor growth in FUS-treated
tumors colonized by therapeutic cells, while growth rates in
controls including non-FUS treated mice, animals treated with
only FUS, and subjects injected with wild-type EcN were
substantially higher (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 6). The observed
effect on tumor growth was comparable to that obtained by
systemically administering antibody-based immune checkpoint
inhibitors against αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1, or by systemically
injecting pre-activated therapeutic EcN. However, unlike each of
these established treatments, whose activity depends solely on the
systemic biodistribution of the injected agents and thus carries
potential for side-effects, FUS-activated bacterial therapy can act
in a spatially localized fashion. To illustrate this localization, after
completing this experiment, we collected tumors, livers, and
spleens, chemically homogenized them, and plated the suspension
on selective media. By counting the percentage of activated
bacteria, we ﬁrst demonstrated that our thermal switch is triggered
in targeted tumors and remains active for at least two weeks post-
activation (Fig. 4d). We then examined the percentage of activated
bacterial agents in the tumors, livers and spleens of FUS-treated
animals, which conﬁrmed that our activation is primarily localized
to targeted tumors while sparing bystander tissues (Fig. 4e).
One of the six FUS-activated tumors disappeared as a result of
the treatment, and bacterial activation inside it could not be
quantiﬁed. This tumor does not represent the typical outcome of
this therapy. In three out of nine FUS-treated tumors, ultrasound

failed to activate the therapeutic bacterial circuit. This could be
due to limitations in our heating setup, which is currently capable
of only partially heating the tumor mass. Since EcN have been
shown to colonize discrete regions within A20 tumors64, these
microbes could have been poorly heated if their locations did not
coincide with the ultrasound focus (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Clinical FUS systems that use MRI feedback and dynamic
mechanical or electrical focusing to ensure the precise heating of
deﬁned volumes can overcome these limitations by heating the
whole tumor65. The three non-activated mice were removed from
our analysis of tumor growth. However, even without excluding
these animals, the therapeutic EcN and FUS-treated mice show a
signiﬁcant reduction in endpoint tumor volume compared to
mice treated with only therapeutic EcN or only FUS, with p-
values of 0.0002 and 0.0001, respectively in a Dunnett’s multiple
comparisons test. Overall, our in vivo experiments demonstrated
that EcN cells engineered for thermally controlled checkpoint
inhibition are able to home to and engraft in tumors from
systemic circulation, become activated speciﬁcally in response to
FUS, maintain this activity for at least two weeks after a 1-hour
FUS treatment and signiﬁcantly reduce tumor growth.
Discussion
Our results establish a system for targeted probiotic immu-
notherapy that couples the special ability of therapeutic bacteria
to home into the necrotic core of solid tumors with the capacity
of FUS to locally activate their therapeutic function. The sus-
tained activation of these therapeutic bacteria is enabled by a
thermal state switch developed through high throughput genetic
engineering to have low baseline activity, rapid induction upon
stimulation and sustained activity in situ. When this state switch

is used to actuate the release of immune checkpoint inhibitors,
the resulting engineered microbes can be activated inside tumors
by brief FUS exposure to secrete their therapeutic payload over an
extended timeframe and substantially reduce tumor growth.
The growing body of work on bacteria-based therapies66–69 and
the increasing clinical acceptance of FUS60,61,70,71 provide FUS-
actuated bacterial therapeutics a path to ultimate clinical imple-
mentation. Potential disease targets include cancers with readily
identiﬁed primary masses that are challenging to resect surgically,
such as head-and-neck, ovarian, pancreatic or brain tumors. FUS-
actuated bacterial therapeutics could be also relevant to metastatic
tumors since microbial therapy in a single tumor mass can gen-
erate a strong adaptive immune response leading to the elimination
of distant tumor lesions through the abscopal effect72. While EcN
cells colonizing A20 tumors have been shown to not disseminate
out of tumors into healthy organs72, other therapeutic models have
been described that could foster the dissemination of therapeutic
microbes to secondary tumor sites while avoiding healthy organs73.
Such models would further increase the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
locally activated therapeutic microbes beyond the primary tumor.
However, further work will be needed to optimize the timing, dose
and molecular identity of FUS-activated therapy release for each
application. To enhance therapeutic efﬁcacy, it may be beneﬁcial to
combine FUS-activated bacterial therapeutics with other molecular
or cellular therapies. For example, engineered bacteria and immune
cells have distinct and often complementary tumor entry and
engraftment proﬁles. Engineering microbes that successfully enter
immunosuppressed tumor regions to secrete checkpoint inhibitors
or cytokines could help make this environment more accessible to
engineered T cells. In this way, the bacteria and T cells can
synergistically exert their therapeutic function from the inside-out
and from the outside-in, respectively. Beyond tumor therapy,
locally activated bacterial agents have potential utility in a wide
array of other biomedical applications. For example, FUS-
controlled state switches could be useful in controlling the activ-
ity of gut microbes in vivo74, the function of cell-based living
materials in vitro75–78, and in industrial metabolic engineering27,79.
Methods
All animal procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the California
Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Plasmid construction and molecular biology. All plasmids were designed using
SnapGene (GSL Biotech) and assembled via reagents from New England Biolabs
for KLD mutagenesis (E0554S) or Gibson Assembly (E2621L). After assembly,
constructs were transformed into NEB Turbo (C2984I) and NEB Stable (C3040I)
E. coli for growth and plasmid preparation. The Bxb1 recombinase-encoding gene
was a kind gift of Richard Murray (Caltech). Integrated DNA Technologies syn-
thesized other genes and all PCR primers. Plasmids containing the αCTLA-4, αPD-
L1, and Axe-Txe genes were kind gifts from of Tal Danino (Columbia University).
Preparation of cell lines for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Plasmids con-
taining engineered genetic circuits were transformed into Nissle 1917 E. coli
(Mutaﬂor®). Nissle cells were cultured in LB broth (Sigma) and grown on LB agar
plates (Sigma) containing appropriate antibiotics. Singular colonies were picked into
LB broth and grown overnight in a shaking incubator (30 °C, 250 rpm). The next
day, optical density measurements (OD600) were taken, and the saturated cultures
were diluted to 0.1 OD600. Diluted cultures were then allowed to grow to exponential
phase until they reached 0.6 OD600 before starting assays. Optical density mea-
surements were taken using a Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Scientiﬁc) in cuvette mode.
Western blot. Five milliliters of cell media were collected for each sample and
concentrated with an Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit. Concentrated cell
media was then mixed with Laemmli loading buffer and BME before loading into a
pre-cast polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel (Bio Rad) and ran at 75 V for 140 min.
Western blotting was performed using the Transblot Turbo apparatus and nitro-
cellulose membrane kit (Bio Rad). Transfer was performed at 25 V for 7 min.
Membranes were blocked with 5% Blotto milk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in
0.05% TBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Primary staining was performed
using a 1:200 dilution of the mouse anti-His sc-8036 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech)
overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then washed three times for 15 min at 4 °C with 0.05%
TBS-Tween and stained for 4 h with a 1:1000 dilution of the mouse IgG kappa
binding protein (m-IgGκ BP) conjugated to Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) (Santa
Cruz Biotech, sc-516102) at room temperature. After three 15-minute washes, HRP
visualization was performed using Super signal west Pico PLUS reagent (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). Imaging was performed in a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP gel imager.
A subsequent epi white light image of the blot under the same magniﬁcation was
acquired to visualize the stained molecular weight standards.
Thermal regulation assay. Once bacterial cell cultures reached approximately 0.6
OD600, 50 μL aliquots of each sample were transferred into individual Bio-Rad PCR
strips with optically transparent caps and subsequently heated in conditions spe-
ciﬁc to the experiment using a Bio-Rad C100 Touch thermocycler with the lid set
to 50 °C. Following heating, cells continued to incubate overnight undisturbed at
either 30 °C (Fig. 1) or 37 °C (Figs. 2–4). The PCR strips were then removed,
vortexed, and spun down, and the green ﬂuorescence of each of the samples was
measured using the Strategene MX3005p qPCR (Agilent) and an unampliﬁed FAM
ﬁlter. To measure cell density, the samples were diluted 1:4 with fresh LB media
(without antibiotic) and then transferred into individual wells of a 96-well plate
(Costar black/clear bottom). Optical density measurements were taken using the
SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). In order to quantify the
temperature-dependent gene expression (E) using background-subtracted, OD-
normalized ﬂuorescence (Figs. 1b–d, f, 2c), Eq. (1) was used:

μL per mouse intravenously. Ultrasound was applied for a total of 1 h at 43 °C with 50% duty cycle and 5-min pulse duration. c Tumor sizes measured over
two weeks in mice treated with wildtype EcN, therapeutic microbes in the absence of FUS, therapeutic microbes and FUS treatment, or FUS treatment

were analyzed for the [therapeutic EcN, FUS] groups, ten mice for the wildtype group, four for the therapeutic EcN (pre-activated), and six mice for the PD-
L1 mAb + CTLA-4 mAb group. Ten mice were analyzed for the therapeutic condition, where three failed to activate. Data from nine therapeutic mice is

blank optical density was determined as the average of n = 4 samples of
untransformed Nissle cells, as opposed to engineered Nissle cells, in LB. Samples
with normalized Fsample < Fblank were recorded as E = 0.
Screens to optimize circuit behavior. To improve Bxb1 thermal regulation, a
sequence randomized library of the RBS, start codon, and ssrA degradation tag was
ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies. PCR products that included the Bxb1
coding region and immediately surrounding sequences were ampliﬁed using cus-
tom primers and were inserted into the backbone of the rest of the parent plasmid
using Gibson Assembly (Fig. 2b–d). This library was transformed into EcN and
plated on LB Agar plates with antibiotic resistance at a low colony density of
approximately 30 colonies per petri dish. Following overnight incubation at 30 °C
to allow the colonies to become visible, these plates were then replicated into two
daughter petri dishes using a replica-plating tool (VWR 25395-380). The parent
petri dish was incubated at 4 °C until the conclusion of the experiment. One
daughter plate was grown overnight at the baseline temperature of 37 °C, and the
other was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h and then moved to 37 °C overnight. After
colonies became visible, the plates were imaged using a 530/28 nm emission ﬁlter to
determine colonies that were ﬂuorescent at the ‘on’ temperature but not at the ‘off’
temperature (Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imager). Promising library variants were
then picked from the corresponding parent petri dish at 4 °C and analyzed against
the parent plasmid of the library using the liquid culture ﬂuorescence-based assay
described above.
Percent switching assay. Strips of liquid bacteria samples were prepared and
incubated in the Bio-Rad Touch thermocycler. After the prescribed thermal sti-
mulus and incubation at 37 °C, PCR strips were removed, vortexed, and spun down
on a tabletop centrifuge. Five 1:10 serial dilutions in liquid LB were then per-
formed, transferring 10 μL of sample into 90 μL of LB media sequentially. After
thorough mixing, 50 μL of the most diluted samples was plated onto an LB plate
and allowed to incubate at 30 °C overnight. Upon the appearance of visible colo-
nies, plates were imaged using the same Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imager with both
blue epiﬂuorescence illumination and the 530/28 nm emission ﬁlters. The per-
centage of colonies in the ‘on state’ (P) was determined according to Eq. (2):
P ¼ number of GFP positive colonies counted on a plate

Flow cytometry. EcN cells were incubated for 24 h before assaying with a ﬂow
cytometer (MACSQuant VYB) that was thoroughly cleaned to ensure that there are
no counts being detected from debris. EcN cells were resuspended in cold PBS +
0.5% BSA (ﬁltered with a 0.2 micron ﬁlter) to prevent clumping and were run at 3
different dilutions (targeting 1e6, 1e7, and 1e8 cells/mL).
Animal procedures. Female BALB/cJ mice aged 8-12 weeks were purchased from
Jackson Laboratory for use in these in vivo experiments. All core facilities are
maintained speciﬁc-pathogen free. Rodents are housed in HEPA-ﬁltered micro-
isolator caging systems at up to ﬁve mice per cage. Environmental conditions, such
as temperature, humidity and lighting are regulated and monitored for proper level
and consistency. A temperature probe is in at least one exhaust air vent per room
and is monitored 24 h a day. Water puriﬁed by reverse osmosis (RO) is provided ad
libitum to rodents via water bottles. Feed (PicoLab Rodent Diet 5053) is received
irradiated to eliminate harmful bacteria and viruses and is provided ad libitum via
stainless steel wire cage lids with integral feeders. Environmental speciﬁcations for
mouse housing rooms, including maximum and minimum temperature and
humidity values are recorded daily by a member of the animal care staff using a
hand-held, battery operated, digital temperature monitoring device. Room tem-
perature is maintained between 71 and 75 degrees F according to the animals’
physiological needs, and humidity is maintained between 30-70%. Lighting cycle
for all facilities is 13 h on & 11 h off (light cycle 6:00AM - 7:00PM). All air provided
to the core animal facilities is ﬁltered and non-recirculated. Animal facilities at
Caltech are on-site and are fully accredited by the Association for the Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Care International (AAALAC). All experiments
involving animals are reviewed by the Caltech Animal Care and Use Committee
and are subject to annual review. To establish A20 tumor models in mice, 5 ´ 106
A20 cells [TIB-208, ATCC] were collected and suspended in 100 μL phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) prior to subcutaneous injection into the ﬂank of each mouse.
When tumor volumes reached approximately 100 mm3, engineered EcN cells
prepared according to the procedure outlined in the “Preparation of cell lines for
in vitro and in vivo experiments” section above were then collected by cen-
trifugation (3000 g for 5 min), washed with PBS three times, and diluted in PBS to
0.625 OD600. 100 μL of the resulting solution was injected into each of the A20
tumor bearing mice via tail vein. For some conditions, mice were injected with a
combination of αCTLA-4 (200 µg per mouse) and αPD-L1 (100 µg per mouse)
checkpoint inhibitors intraperitoneally. These murine checkpoint inhibitors
(αCTLA-4 clone 9D9 and αPD-L1 clone 10 F.9G2) were obtained from BioXCell.
For thermal actuation using ultrasound, mice were anesthetized using a 2%
isoﬂurane-air mixture and placed on a dedicated animal holder. Anesthesia was
maintained over the course of the ultrasound procedure using 1–1.5% isoﬂurane,
adjusted in real-time to maintain the respiration rate at 20-30 breaths per minute.
Body temperature was continuously monitored using a ﬁber optic rectal thermo-
meter (Neoptix). When appropriate, the target ﬂank was thermally activated using
the automated FUS setup described below, cycling between the temperatures of
43 °C and 37 °C every 5 min for 1 h of total heating. Following ultrasound treat-
ment, the mouse was returned to its cage and the size of its tumor was measured
with a caliper to track the therapeutic efﬁcacy. When the tumors reached
~1000 mm3 (below the 1500 mm3 maximal tumor size/burden permitted by our
animal protocol) mice were culled and the tumors were collected for analysis. Mice
that did not have microbial cells in their tumors were excluded from the study.
Tumor and organ analysis. Tumors and organs (liver and spleen) were collected
and homogenized in ten milliliters of PBS containing 2 mg/ml collagenase and
0.1 mg/ml DNase for one hour at 37 °C. Homogenized tissues were serially diluted
and plated onto LB plates with antibiotic selection to quantify the number of cells
colonizing the tissues. The percentage of cells activated within tissues was deter-
mined by counting the number of GFP positive cells.
Feedback-controlled focused ultrasound. We developed a closed loop thermal
control setup to maintain a speciﬁed predetermined temperature within the tumor
of a mouse by modulating the intensity of the FUS. This setup includes a water bath
ﬁlled with pure distilled water that is being actively cleaned and degassed with an
AQUAS‐10 water conditioner (ONDA) and maintained at 33 °C with a sous vide
immersion cooker (InstantPot Accu Slim). A tumor-bearing mouse that has been
anesthetized as described above is fastened nose up vertically to an acrylic arm that
is connected to a manual 3D positioning system (Thorlabs) to enable 3D translation
of the mouse within the water bath. A Velmex BiSlide motorized positioning system
is used to submerge and position the 0.67 MHz FUS transducer (Precision Acoustics
PA717) such that the focal point of the transducer lies within the tumor of the
mouse. A signal generator (B&K #4054B) generates the thermal ultrasound signal
which is then ampliﬁed (AR #100A250B) and sent to the ultrasound transducer.
The water in this chamber acts as the coupling medium to transfer the ultrasound
wave from the transducer to the tumor. To measure the internal tumor temperature
during a heating session we temporarily implant a thin ﬁber optic temperature
probe (Neoptix, T1) into the tumor. The custom-ordered probe has a sensing tip
with a diameter of 400 µm and length of <2 mm. To insert the probe into tumors we
followed the following procedure, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 8: (1) shave
the tumor before the mouse is placed on a holder, (2) insert a 25-gauge needle into
the tumor to guide the fragile thermal probe, (3) insert the ﬁber-optic probe into the
path created by the needle and secure the probe with duct tape. This temperature
readout is also used to align the focus of the transducer with the tumor by emitting a
constant test thermal ultrasound signal. Once the system is aligned, we run a
MATLAB closed loop thermal control script that regulates the signal generator
output. Feedback for the controller is provided by the temperature measurements
acquired with a sampling rate of 4 Hz. The actuator for the controller is the voltage
amplitude of the continuous sinusoidal signal at 0.67 MHz used to drive the FUS
transducer, where the voltage is adjusted also at 4 Hz. The transducer acoustic
pressure had to be slightly adjusted for each mouse, but typically stayed between
0.6-0.7 MPa (free ﬁeld). The acoustic pressure ﬁeld generated by the 670 kHz
transducer near its acoustic focus was measured using a Precision Acoustics low
frequency-calibrated ﬁber-optic hydrophone attached to a Velmex X slide transla-
table stage. The ﬁber optic hydrophone was in a water bath degassed using an Onda
water conditioning system at room temperature. The peak negative pressure was
measured at the focal point to be 0.6 MPa given a driving voltage of 35 V peak-to-
peak. Full width at half-maximum pressure was measured to be 3.5 mm in the
transverse direction and 35 mm in the longitudinal direction (Supplementary Fig. 7,
a, b). The system uses a PID controller with anti-windup control that modiﬁes the
amplitude of the thermal ultrasound waveform to achieve a desired temperature in
the targeted tissues. The Kp, Ki, Kd, and Kt parameters for the PID and anti-windup
were tuned using Ziegler-Nichols method, and in some cases adjusted further
through trial-and-error tuning to achieve effective thermal control.
Statistics and replicates. Data is plotted and reported in the text as the mean ±
S.E.M. Sample size is n = 4 biological replicates in all in vitro experiments unless
otherwise stated. This sample size was chosen based on preliminary experiments
indicating that it would be sufﬁcient to detect signiﬁcant differences in mean
values. P values were calculated using a two-tailed unpaired t-test.
