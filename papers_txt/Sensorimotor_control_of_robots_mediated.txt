Living tissues are still far from being used as practical components in biohybrid robots because of limitations in 
life span, sensitivity to environmental factors, and stringent culture procedures. Here, we introduce fungal myce-
lia as an easy-­to-­use and robust living component in biohybrid robots. We constructed two biohybrid robots that 
use the electrophysiological activity of living mycelia to control their artificial actuators. The mycelia sense their 
environment and issue action potential–like spiking voltages as control signals to the motors and valves of the 
robots that we designed and built. The paper highlights two key innovations: first, a vibration-­ and electromag-
netic interference–shielded mycelium electrical interface that allows for stable, long-­term electrophysiological 
bioelectric recordings during untethered, mobile operation; second, a control architecture for robots inspired by 
neural central pattern generators, incorporating rhythmic patterns of positive and negative spikes from the living 
mycelia. We used these signals to control a walking soft robot as well as a wheeled hard one. We also demon-
strated the use of mycelia to respond to environmental cues by using ultraviolet light stimulation to augment the 
robots’ gaits.
INTRODUCTION
With extreme care and effort, robots can operate with animal-­like 
gaits that impress even a lay audience. The efficiency, durability, re-
peatability, and capabilities of these demonstrations, however, still 
do not match those of their biological counterparts, such as dogs 
and humans.
Organisms solve these hardware issues by growing, not assem-
bling, sensors, actuators, and the neural networks that connect them. 
A human fingertip, for example, has more than 3000 mechanorecep-
tors attached to thousands of interconnected nerves and neuronal 
signaling pathways that communicate with a distally located brain 
(1, 2). The nanoscale bottom-­up assembly processes that enable these 
features are not a capability of human technology yet; therefore, syn-
thetic robots do not approach the capabilities of natural organisms. 
One approach for biohybrid robots is the use of living tissue to con-
trol mechanisms (3, 4). In some ways, this approach is akin to the 
use of unconventional computing to control robots (5) as opposed to 
traditional controllers, such as the design of Belousov-­Zhabotinsky 
liquid marbles with light-­stimulated controllers, chemical taxis con-
trollers (6–9), and autonomous liquid robots (10).
Two primary methods of living biohybrid machine construction 
involve directing cultured cells into useful forms and excising and 
using tissues after natural formation. Among the five kingdoms, 
animal-­based biohybrid machines are the most popular in literature 
because of their implied motility (11, 12), and, after forming the tis-
sue construct, they have been controlled by pulses of optical, electri-
cal, or magnetic stimuli (11, 13).
Culturing animal cells typically involves growing muscle bun-
dles from single cells through self-­assembly and embedding them 
into mechanical structures or scaffolding (11, 13). This method has 
been applied to various biohybrid robots usually composed of ei-
ther skeletal or cardiac muscle cells (3, 14–21). Whole muscle tis-
sues have also been used for biohybrid robots, where their actuation 
is typically triggered electrically or chemically (4, 22–26). Animal 
biohybrids have been used for swimming, walking, and other 
behaviors—for example, frog and cardiac muscles for swimming (22, 
23), Aplysia californica I2 muscles for walking (24), earthworm mus-
cles for bio-­micropumps and valves (4, 25), and neural cells to con-
trol robots (27). Although these accomplishments are exciting, there 
are many challenges to solve related to animal biohybrids and the 
difficulty of maintaining healthy, living tissues in pragmatic envi-
ronmental conditions (28). For example, a sterile environment and 
daily medium exchange with infusion of supplements and antibiot-
ics such as penicillin are required to maintain living cell cultures.
Nonanimal systems have started to garner interest because they 
may be less prone to some of these issues and provide other oppor-
tunities, such as reduced complexity. These nonanimal biohybrids 
are primarily based on plants and bacteria. Like animals, bacteria 
are predominantly researched because of their motility (12) and have 
been used for tumor site detection (29), targeted payload delivery 
(30), and micromotors (31). Plant-­based biohybrid systems are typi-
cally built not only for nontraditional robotics use cases, such as 
environmental sensing (32) and energy harvesting (33), but also as 
actuators (34). The relatively short life span of individual bacteria 
and a plant’s slower movements [see exceptions (35, 36)] provide 
challenges. Slime mold (Physarum polycephalum) has also been used 
to control robots through its physical oscillatory movements (37), 
but the shape change is on the order of minutes.
The kingdom Fungi is less explored for biohybrid robots; how-
ever, it offers several potential advantages over other kinds of or-
ganisms. Unlike animal cells, fungi can be easily cultured in large 
quantities and have relatively simple engineering requirements for 
sustaining life (38, 39). Common fungal species have demonstrated 
the ability to thrive in extreme environments, including the Arctic 
and Antarctic (40), nuclear radiation sites (40, 41), and highly acid-
ic or saline conditions (42), making them promising candidates for

various robotics applications requiring robust operation in hazard-
ous conditions.
Mycelial networks comprise the mostly subterranean portion of 
fungi; they sense, communicate, and transport nutrients and water 
(43). Mycelia are composed of filamentous, branching hyphae and 
can grow to extremely large scales (44). Their interconnected, complex 
networks exhibit rapid signal transmission, growth, and the produc-
tion of signaling molecules (38, 45, 46).
These fungi are also sensitive to environmental cues, such as light 
and chemicals (39). Their light sensitivity is believed to be because 
of proteins, such as opsins, phytochromes, and white collar-­1 (WC-­
1), that change conformation in response to light. WC-­1 is a blue-­
light photoreceptor that is sensitive to the wavelengths between 
blue and ultraviolet (UV) (39, 47, 48). These light-­sensitive proteins 
are also likely involved in hyphal growth regulation and circadian 
rhythms (49).
The electrical signals that are indicative of these environmental 
cues, as well as other regulatory processes, are transmitted through 
the transmembrane movement of ions. Action potential–like signals 
have been recorded intracellularly and extracellularly from several 
fungal species, such as Neurospora crassa (45), Armillaria bulbosa 
(46), Ganoderma resinaceum (50), and Pleurotus djamor (51). For 
example, A. bulbosa can produce electrical signals between 1 and 
5 Hz under mechanical stimulation (46). Mechanically sensitive ion 
channels permeable to calcium and potassium have been described 
in fungal species (52). Changes in membrane potential producing 
action potential–like events may be mechanistically similar to the 
depolarization and repolarization phases of action potentials in ani-
mal neurons (53). Our intention in this work was not to explore the 
mechanisms of electrical excitability in fungi but, instead, to use these 
signals to sense the environment and control robots.
Fungi have recently drawn the attention of researchers who are 
interested in harnessing their unique characteristics to develop bio-
hybrid solutions. Some examples where a living fungus was used for 
biohybrid applications include pressure-­detection insoles (54), fungal 
“skin” sensors (55), self-­healing mycelium-­based composite materials 
created using 3D-printed hydrogel matrices (56), and the mapping of 
action potential waveforms to 50 different English words (57).
Here, we introduce biohybrid robots controlled by fungal mycelia, 
focusing on two key advancements. First, we have developed a vibra-
tion-­ and electromagnetic interference (EMI)–shielded mycelium-­
electrical interface for stable, long-­term bioelectric recordings during 
untethered, mobile operation. Second, we have crafted a control archi-
tecture for robots inspired by neural central pattern generators, incor-
porating rhythmic patterns of positive and negative spikes from living 
mycelia. We combined these two advances to use mycelia to control 
the locomotion of both a tethered, 3D-­printed soft robot and an 
untethered, wheeled robot. In both cases, we also demonstrated the 
use of UV light incident on the mycelia to alter the trajectories of 
the robots.
RESULTS
Fungal mycelium
We selected Pleurotus eryngii as the fungus to interface with our 
electromechanical system because of its favorable characteristics, 
such as filamentous mycelial growth pattern, rapid growth rate, and 
nonpoisonous character (58). Our fungal culture protocol used the 
following steps: agar medium preparation and sterilization, transfer 
of the medium to petri dishes, inoculation, incubation, and subcul-
turing (see fig. S1, steps 1 to 7). We conducted mycelium growth 
tests in petri dishes of two sizes: small (60 mm) and large (150 mm) 
diameters. The fungus typically requires ~ 14 to 33 days to fully in-
tegrate into the robot’s scaffolding, depending on the dish size. De-
tailed methodologies and results can be found in Fig. 1A, fig. S2 (A 
and B), the Fungal culture protocols section, and the Growth test 
section in the Supplementary Methods.
Hardware design for stable electrophysiological 
mycelium measurement
We chose extracellular electrophysiology (EEP) methods to estab-
lish a bioelectric connection between Pleurotus mycelia and our ro-
bot’s microcontroller unit (MCU). EEP offers several advantages, 
including noninvasiveness, wide spatial contact with mycelia, stable 
long-­term recordings, and high temporal resolution when using dif-
ferential electrodes (59, 60).
We used this mycelium scaffold to measure voltage spikes from 
the hyphal bundles, as shown in Fig. 1A. The plates featured three 
electrode inputs (E1, E2, and EGND; Fig. 1B). Figure 1C displays the 
scaffold integrated with its casing, electrodes, and mycelia. We also 
demonstrated effective electrode positioning, allowing the mycelia 
to grow onto the electrodes and ensuring stable and cohesive con-
tact with the hyphal bundles. Several microscopic images capturing 
these interfaces and the fungal mycelia are presented in Fig. 1D and 
fig. S3 (A to D). Detailed discussions on the fabrication and integra-
tion procedures of the 3D-­printed scaffold, along with the imaging 
procedure, are described in the 3D-­printed mycelium scaffold sec-
tion and the Fungi imaging section in the Supplementary Methods. 
These scaffold modules facilitated the growth of the mycelia into the 
electromechanical robot interface; for instance, a starfish-­like legged 
soft robot is illustrated in Fig. 1E. The mycelia within the scaffold 
generate spontaneous electrical action potential–like signals and are 
also capable of producing these potentials in response to UV stimu-
lation. These signals function as both motor commands and sensory 
feedback, allowing the robot to control its movement. The techniques 
that we use to measure these signals have been used previously for 
other biological cells and tissues (59, 60). The bioelectric, possibly 
cellular-­level circuit model that we use is based on Ohm’s law and is 
depicted in Fig. 2A
where Vnative is the spontaneous action potentials, Im is the mem-
brane current, and Ze is the equivalent impedance.
In addition, for the signal recording circuit, we used two elec-
trodes (E1 and E2) in the mycelium and a ground electrode (EGND) 
in agar medium. We connected E1 and E2 to differential input ports 
and EGND to a ground port of our high-­resolution data acquisition 
system (ADC-­24, PicoLog) that has a 24-­bit analog-­to-­digital con-
verter (ADC) with four channels and a maximum sampling rate of 
16 S s−1 . We placed the measurement setup in a custom-­built Faraday 
cage for long-­term recordings. The complete measurement setup is 
shown in Fig. 2B and fig. S4 (A and B), and setup requirements and 
fabrication are thoroughly discussed in the Fungal signal recording 
setup section.

mycelia over a period of more than 30 days. To validate the authen-
ticity of the signals, we used a pure agar plate as a control. Our 
recording procedure involved recording from the day of inocula-
tion, as the mycelia grew and visually reached the electrodes on the 
small plate, and recording from a fully grown mycelium plate, with 
a parallel agar plate serving as a control for comparison. We have 
presented the bioelectric signals from both the plates and the con-
trol in Fig. 1A and fig. S5C. Before starting the electrical record-
ings, we also measured the electrode dc resistance in both the 
mycelium-­grown and control plates. The electrode resistance was 
2.2 ± 0.2 megohms for the agar plate and 1.4 ± 0.25 megohms for 
the mycelium plate.
Our recorded data display no electrical spiking activity before 
the hyphae contacting the electrodes or in control plates with a base-
line signal of <20 μV (refer to Fig. 1A and fig. S5C). Conversely, we 
observed large spiking activity in mycelium plates. We discussed 
resistance, bioelectric signals, and signal authenticity measurement 
procedures in the Electrode resistance and Mycelium scaffold signal 
recording setup sections in the Supplementary Methods.
Signal processing and analysis
We processed the raw signals from the 30-­day-­long recorded fungal 
datasets by considering several factors: baseline voltage, sampling, 
digital filtering, noise exclusion, data normalization, prominent

thresholding, peak identification, and peak analysis. We reported 
eight signal characteristics, including the analysis of spontaneous 
action potentials over time; probability density distribution for sig-
nal peaks, heights, and widths; and the relationships between height 
and width, height and time, width and time, and spiking frequency 
(peaks s−1).
We applied the Savitzky-­Golay filter (61) to a set of digital data 
points for the purpose of smoothing. We chose this filter because it 
is particularly effective at reducing noise while preserving the key 
features of the signal, making it highly suitable for a variety of time 
series data applications. The filter operates by fitting a polynomial of 
a specified order to the data points within a certain window size. For 
our application, we used a third-­order polynomial (k = 3) and a 
commonly used window size of 11 points (n = 11); see Eq. 2.

where Vfiltered,i is the smoothed voltage value at point i, Vi+j is the 
original voltage data points, and cj is the filter coefficient.
To identify signal peaks in fungal datasets, for each data point Vi 
in the fungal signal array Vfungi = [V1, V2, …, Vn], we applied a con-
dition: If Vi is greater than its immediate neighbors (Vi > Vi−1 and 
Vi > Vi+1), then Vi is considered a peak. We also set a prominence 
level to be compared with a predefined threshold.
For determining peak height and width, we extracted the voltage 
peak and the defined region using Eq. 3, adopted from (62), fol-
lowed by estimating the height using Eq. 4. The first step involved 
calculating the evaluation height, after which the function identi-
fied the left and right boundaries of the peak height. The peak width 
was then estimated as the horizontal distance between these bound-
aries, providing a precise measurement of the peak’s width in the 
voltage data. This approach offers valuable insights into the signal’s 
characteristics by accurately determining the peak dimensions.
where Vp(t) is the peak voltage, Vraw(t) is the fungal raw voltage sig-
nal, B(t) is the mean baseline voltage, P is the prominence, heval is the 
evaluation height, hp(t) is the peak height, hr is the relative height, 
and [t1, t2] is the peak region.
We identified the baseline voltage, B(t), and net baseline voltage 
changes ΔB(t) of the recorded signal from both mycelium and con-
trol plates as approximately less than 2 μV. We implemented the peak 
detection model in Python, as shown in the flowchart in fig. S6. For 
a detailed description of the experiment design, please refer to the 
Fungal signal analysis method and Statistical analysis sections.
Figure 2C presents a 5-­hour fungal signal, specifically highlight-
ing the 14th day of recording from a small plate (Fig. 1A). Our re-
sults show the existence of multiple bands of signal widths (τnative), 
such as 1.5, 2, and 2.5 s (see Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we observed 
that the spiking frequency (ξnative) can reach up to 36 peaks min−1, 
with a mean of 11 peaks min−1 (refer to Fig. 2E). The Vnative had an 
average value of ~ 194 μV, with a maximum positive peak of 1140 μV 
and a negative spike of −216 μV (Fig. 2F). The mean spike height 
was 60 μV, with a range of up to 1000 μV, as reported in Fig. 2G and 
fig. S7A. The mean τnative was 1.1 s, and the  τmax
native  was ~10 s, as 
shown in Fig. 2G and fig. S7 (C and D). In addition, we analyzed 
complete fungal data for both plates. We selected 48 hours of data 
from each week over a 30-­day period. We discussed the detailed re-
sults in the Small and large petri dish mycelium scaffold weekly data 
analysis section in the Supplementary Methods. The corresponding 
figures for the small plate datasets are figs. S8 to S11, and the figures 
for the large plate datasets are figs. S12 to S15. The complete ana-
lyzed results show that the mean baseline potential for both plates 
reached Vnative ~ 135 μV with maximum peaks of Vnative ~ 1868 μV 
and minimum peaks of Vnative ~ 35 μV (Fig. 2H). Similarly, the 
mean spiking frequency varied around ξnative ~ 0.12 spikes s−1, with 
a maximum of ξnative ~ 0.6 spikes s−1 over the course of the 30-­day 
recordings (Fig. 2E and figs. S8 to S15).
In our study, we used the light-­sensing abilities of Pleurotus my-
celia to alter the trajectory of our robots. We conducted tests using 
four types of light (UV, blue, red, and white) and measured the result-
ing voltage spikes. From our results, we found that fungi were more 
sensitive to UV light stimulation, so we ran several tests with varia-
tions in intensity, duration, and height. We also tested for other light 
responses (blue, red, and white) at optimized UV exposure param-
eters. We discussed the detailed experimental procedure and setup 
in fig. S16 (A and B) and in the UV light stimulation setup section 
and the Blue, red, and white (BRW) light stimulation setup section 
in the Supplementary Methods (63). For our control data, we mea-
sured the voltage over time from agar medium without mycelium 
growth and repeated all of the experiments at least seven times.
We report the UV stimulation data from two different plates. In 
Fig. 3A, we report data from the first plate with variations in UV 
intensity from 0.1 W cm−2 < Γ < 1 W cm−2 at a UV source height of 
12 cm. We analyzed Vlight and τlight at full width at half maximum 
(FWHM). We observed a consistent increase in action potential 
amplitude, ranging from Vlight = 25 ± 4 μV at 0.1 W cm−2 to 
Vlight = 281 ± 14 μV at 1 W cm−2 with a constant width of 1.3 ± 0.1 s 
(see fig. S16, C and D). In contrast, UV stimulation of the agar 
plate alone did not show any substantial spiking activity (refer to 
fig. S16E). For the second mycelium plate, we observed even larger 
peaks ranging between Vlight = 208 ± 72 μV and Vlight = 18,569 ± 1772 μV 
(refer to fig. S16F). We also conducted variable exposure height 
tests by adjusting the gap between the UV source and the plate in 
UV tests, ranging from 12 to 20 cm, and varied the exposure time of 
UV light from 2 to 12 s. We have included all analyzed data in Table 1 
and in fig. S17 (A to E).
We found that, at longer wavelengths beyond UV, our mycelium 
scaffold only responded to blue light stimulation, with Vlight poten-
tials reaching 83 ± 11 μV at an illumination distance of 12 cm and 
an exposure time of 2 s. We did not, however, observe any spontane-
ous response in the mycelium when exposed to red and white light. 
We did not see any red and white light response in agar plates (see 
fig. S17, F and G).
Mycelium-­directed CPG control model
We categorized the mycelium signals into two types: positive electri-
cal potentials (positive Vnative; Fig. 3Bi) and negative electrical po-
tentials (negative Vnative; Fig. 3Bii) as depicted in Fig. 3B. From these 
analog spikes, we identified four distinct signals. These four analog 
signals were then converted into four digital control inputs as de-
picted in Fig. 3B (iii and vi).
The first type of signal input consisted of spontaneous action po-
tential spiking trains converted to constant digital control signals, 
transforming Vnative height information into constant or binary (0, 
1) digital signals, as shown in Fig. 3Biii. The second type of signal 
input involved spontaneous action potential spiking trains being con-
verted into variable digital control signals, translating Vnative height 
information into variable pulse width modulation (PWM) signals, 
normalized between 0 and 255, also illustrated in Fig. 3Biv. The 
third type of control input was a UV-­stimulated signal with artifi-
cially generated high-­frequency digital signals. We used the V value 
as a threshold; if Vlight was more than the mean Vnative, then we gen-
erated artificial high-­frequency digital signals (Fig. 3Bv). The fourth 
type of control input was a UV light–stimulated central pattern gen-
eration (CPG) as a digital control signal, using only Vlight height in-
formation and translating it into constant PWM signals (Fig. 3Bvi). 
In addition, we incorporated τlight for all applied signals at 80% of 
the detected peak height.
To allow these mycelia to operate the mechatronic system of the 
robot, we developed algorithms to test control scenarios that read

signal generation and transmission to the robots. We discussed 
the detailed control process through a flowchart, which is avail-
able in fig. S18A, the Mycelium-­directed robot control method 
section, and movie S1. We reported the mycelium signal sampled 
every 30 s and performed real-­time calculations for 10 min to de-
tect peak existence and measure peak width (see fig. S18B). We 
then implemented the CPG to control both tethered and unteth-
ered biohybrid robots.
Robot control strategies and demonstrations
We used these signal processing techniques to translate the action 
potentials emitted by the hyphae to control either valves or motors 
in the robots that we built. We used valves for a pneumatically actu-
ated legged robot and motors for an untethered and wheeled hard 
robot. We demonstrated both robots in three control scenarios.
Native, Vnative, electrophysiological control
For Vnative control, which we anticipate could be useful in substan-
tially varying environmental conditions, we used both constant and 
variable PWM signals. We transmitted the width and height infor-
mation of the spontaneous fungal signal to the MCU. The peak height 
and width were mapped to a digital signal. By translating the fungal 
peak information into digital output pins using PWM mode, we 
represented the signal as either high (1) or low (0). We incorporated 
fungal width information using delay functions between each high 
and low state. For soft robots, we used only one digital output pin to 
activate and deactivate the valve; for the motor encoder system, we 
used two digital output pins; and for the wheeled robot, we used a 
total of eight digital output pins with combinations of high and low 
signals with a constant PWM.
Because the Vnative peaks of the mycelium signal are not constant, 
we incorporated both the height and width information. We ex-
tracted the peak and width information from the mycelium signal 
and normalized the height value to the highest PWM value. This 
approach allowed for automatic adjustment of duty cycles and effec-
tive voltage (as described in Eq. 5)
Veff is the effective voltage, Vs is the maximum supply voltage, τo 
is on time, and τp is the period.
Light-­stimulated, Vlight, electrophysiological,  
high-­frequency control
Before starting a demonstration, we first exposed the mycelial scaf-
fold to UV light. We then estimated the height ratio between Vlight 
and Vnative. From our experiments, the height ratios were 3 to 
10 times larger than the spontaneous signal. We then set a threshold 
value of typically ~3 Vnative, such that whenever the UV light expo-
sure caused the mycelium signal to surpass it, we generated a high-­
frequency signal from the MCU at 100% duty cycle without using 
the fungal peak height and width properties.
Light-­stimulated, Vlight, electrophysiological, native control
We followed a similar approach to the Vnative-­based control signals, 
but, in this case, we used only UV-­stimulated spike width and height 
information. We exposed the mycelium plate to UV light for 1 s at a 
20-­s interval to generate a light-­stimulated spiking pattern. We then 
followed the robot with the UV source, periodically exposed the 
mycelia to it, and incorporated each UV-­stimulated spike into the 
digital signal for control.
Tethered legged soft robot
We designed a starfish-­like tethered robot with five soft-­legged 
actuators (L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5) in an isosceles trapezoidal shape, 
featuring interconnected chambers and a strain-­limiting layer for 
bending motion. We connected these actuators to a pentagonal 
central base using an internal channel and a barbed tube connector, 
enabling actuation from a single pressure source, as depicted in 
fig. S19A. For movement, the robot uses an asymmetric friction 
method within its feet [Fs > (Fr1, Fr2, Fr3, Fr4)] to locomote efficiently 
on flat surfaces (64). It involves use of four low-­friction rigid mate-
rials for the feet (Fr1, Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4) and one high-­friction elastomer 
foot (Fs), depicted in fig. S19B.
To facilitate real-­time control of locomotion using Vnative and 
Vlight signals from fungi, we mounted a mycelial scaffold atop the 
robot. Ensuring seamless integration between the robot’s body and 
the scaffold is crucial for movement success, especially in isolating 
external EMI and mechanical interferences and simplifying scaf-
fold replacement. For this integration, we adopted plug and socket 
joints, with the plug part designed on the base and the socket part 
on the scaffold, both in a pentagonal shape. To mitigate mechanical 
noise, we used soft pads and elastomers, and, for electrical noise 
insulation, we implemented a copper mesh layer to ground the 
electrodes to the base. Moreover, we ensured a tight fit between the 
plug and socket components to eliminate any relative movement 
between the robot body and the scaffold during locomotion, as 
illustrated in fig. S19C.
We also used a pressure sensor to gauge the robotic actuation 
output, aligning it with the mycelium input signal. It allowed us to 
verify the actuator’s response time and the width of the fungal signal, 
ensuring precise synchronization between the robot’s movements 
and the mycelium inputs.
For fabrication, we 3D-­printed the legged robot using both soft 
and rigid materials, constructing it as a monolithic structure through 
a multimaterial design approach. The robot’s elastomer offers visco-
elasticity and a low elastic modulus, providing inherent compliance, 
vibration damping, and noise reduction. We include more design 
and fabrication details in fig. S19 (A to E), the Soft legged robot 
design and fabrication section, and the Soft legged robot 3D printing 
fabrication procedure section in the Supplementary Methods. For 
the wiring, we connected mycelium electrodes to an ADC and 
used the microcontroller to issue commands to the valve. We 
discussed the complete circuit and wiring details in fig. S20, the 
Soft legged robot electronics section in the Supplementary Methods, 
and the Pressure sensor integrated soft robot for signal I/O mapping 
setup section.
We began demonstrating the soft robot on a wooden table with 
mycelium-­directed Vnative and its corresponding digital output as a 
change in actuation pressure, control scenario 1. First, we conducted 
a 10-­min test of the robot without attaching the mycelium scaffold 
to the robot’s body but instead placing it inside the Faraday cage 
(refer to fig. S21A and movie S2). During this test, the robot was 
only connected to air sources, although the rest of the electronics, 
scaffold, valve, sensor, and MCU were kept inside the Faraday 
cage. We then demonstrated the robot with the mycelium scaffold

attached to it for 20 min [reported input and output (I/O) data in 
Fig. 4, A and B, and movie S3].
For control scenario 2, we activated Arduino signals at a frequen-
cy of 1 Hz whenever the UV-­stimulated voltage height was more 
than 100 μV. We conducted again tests on the robot both with and 
without the mycelium scaffold attached to its body. Initially, we tested 
the robot without the mycelium scaffold for 4 min (see fig. S21B and 
movie S4), followed by a test with the scaffold attached for 7 min (refer 
to Fig. 4, C and D, and movie S5). Last, we tested control scenario 3, 
shown in fig. S21 (C and D) and movie S6. All three mycelium-­directed 
control scenarios were able to drive the soft robot. In addition, myce-
lium input and robot output signal verification showed an alignment 
between the spiking signals and the corresponding robot pressure un-
der all three tested conditions, with minor computational delays.
Untethered wheeled robot
We designed an untethered wheeled robot for fast movement, in-
corporating a four-­wheel drive system, as shown in fig. S22A. Our 
multilevel design seamlessly integrates mechanical components, 
electronics, and power supplies. At the base level, we installed a 
four-­wheel drive mechanism comprising four dc motors, brackets, 
and an ac-­dc power supply, illustrated in fig. S22 (B and C). We 
equipped each motor with wheels and synchronized the circuit to 
ensure uniform direction of motor rotation. On the second level, 
we placed the mini-­PC, MCU, and motor control circuit, central-
izing the electronic components.
To enable mycelium-­directed control using Vnative and Vlight sig-
nals, we mounted a mycelium scaffold, electrode connectors, and a 
PicoLog DAQ system on the top level, as seen in fig. S22D. We

tackled mechanical and EMI disturbances, such as ground vibra-
tion noise, external perturbations, mini-­PC fan noise, and electro-
magnetic noise from the power supply and wiring, with various 
strategies. We incorporated a vibration isolation system (VIS) be-
tween the second and third levels using vibration-­damping materi-
als, shock-­absorbing sponges, and rubber-­coated wheels to reduce 
mechanical noise. In addition, we placed a sand bed and sponge 
pads on the third level to dampen vibrations from the robot’s move-
ment, securing the plate and electrodes in sand on all sides except 
the top and stabilizing the PicoLog against internal movements. 
To counteract electrical disturbances, we equipped all levels with 
Faraday cages and ensured proper soldering of ground connections 
with copper mesh.
We fabricated the wheeled robot through 3D printing and tradi-
tional assembly methods, including nuts, bolts, screws, and glue. For 
detailed information on the design and fabrication process, refer to 
the Supplementary Materials and the Untethered wheeled robot de-
sign and fabrication section.
We connected the motor wires to the motor driver PCB, powered 
the mini-­PC with ac, and supplied the 
motors with dc from an ac-­dc power 
source. We have documented the com-
plete wiring diagrams, circuit fabrica-
tion, and electronics for the wheeled 
robot in fig. S23A and the Untethered 
wheeled robot electronics section in 
the Supplementary Methods. Before 
implementing full robot control, we 
first tested a single motor with an en-
coder on a motor testbed setup (depicted 
in fig. S23B and the Encoder-­integrated 
dc motor for signal I/O mapping set-
up section) to ensure that the fungal 
input signals synchronized with mo-
tor rotation, applying the same testing 
approach used with the legged robot 
actuators.
We reported signal motor control re-
sults in fig. S24 (A to D), movies S7 to S9, 
and the Motor encoder mapping results 
section in the Supplementary Methods. 
We first tested for 10 min where the my-
celium scaffolds, electronics, and MCU 
were placed in the Faraday cage and 
transmitted the signal directly to a motor 
outside of the environment. We observed 
mycelium signals exhibiting positive and 
negative Vnative, and then, we mapped 
the mycelium input signals to encoder 
output in the form of motor revolu-
tion counts.
We then conducted the wheeled ro-
bot demonstrations. First, we performed 
a demonstration indoors using control 
scenario 1, where we allowed the ro-
bot to drive for 15 min using myceli-
um action potentials ranging between 
95 < Vnative < 130 μV (Fig. 5, A and B, 
and movie S10). We then tested control 
scenario 2, where UV excitation caused the robot to move away from 
the light source. The mycelium data along with the time stamp of 
robot movement and the corresponding video can be found in Fig. 5 
(C and D) and movie S11. Last, we conducted control scenario 3, 
moving the UV light source along the Vlight-­controlled robot. During 
these experiments, we shone UV light onto the mycelium six times 
for 3 min, resulting in recorded Vlight peaks of ~350 μV with a width 
of  ~4 s at 80% FWHM. The corresponding data can be seen in 
fig. S24E and movie S12.
CONCLUSION
We have successfully demonstrated a biohybrid robot controlled 
by bioelectric signals from fungal mycelium. We confirmed that 
the spontaneous and evoked electrical signals originated from liv-
ing fungi by comparing recordings from agar plates without fungi 
with agar plates before and after the mycelium growth reached 
our extracellular electrodes (46, 51). Our focus was to adapt these 
electrical signals for biological sensing and robotic commands.

Our innovations include a 3D-­printed mycelial scaffold for stable 
long-­term recordings, UV and blue light stimulation response 
in mycelia, and a control architecture inspired by central pattern 
generators observed in the animal kingdom (65, 66). We used 
these advances to cause movement in legged and wheeled ro-
bots over long durations while capturing dynamic environmental 
changes as feedback.
Using fungi for developing biohybrid robots brings several ad-
vantages over other approaches, such as more facile and low-­cost 
culture protocols and low risk of contamination while interfacing 
with engineered systems. The mycelia have action potential–like activ-
ity and environmental sensing abilities (39) that persist for months, 
demonstrating the potential for real-­world application, perhaps in 
agriculture or security.
Adapting electrophysiological mycelium signaling to biohybrid 
robotics presents several challenges that need to be addressed. Some 
of these challenges include the plasticity of fungal signals, with grad-
ual weakening observed over time, and the difficulty of capturing 
low-­amplitude signals (<50 μV) at high sampling rates because of 
insufficient resolution. Another challenge is the 30-­s data sampling 
interval that introduces a lag during Vlight control because of fungal 
spiking frequencies. Choosing different sliding window configura-
tions should reduce this lag. Further, and quite obviously, living 
systems die. Addressing these challenges calls for enhanced high-­
precision electronics for signal amplification, as well as techniques 
for regeneration and regrowth of the mycelia.
In the UV experiment, we tested both mycelia and their con-
trol. The experiments showed that UV-­stimulated signals in the 
mycelia ranged from 600 to 17,000 μV, whereas those in agar-­
stimulated controls hovered around 10 to 20 μV. In conclusion, 
although some activity was observed in the controls, it was quite 
small compared with that of the mycelia, where signals were 60-­ to 
1000-­fold larger. To more accurately quantify the effects of UV 
stimulation, however, further validation through biochemistry 
and genomics is needed to isolate our measurements from poten-
tial heat effects.
Last, this emerging field of fungal biohybrids warrants increased 
cooperation, standardization, and effort. Fungal electrophysiology 
has been studied by a few researchers, such as Slayman et al. (45) and 
Olsson and Hansson (46) through intracellular electrophysiology, 
and Adamatzky and Gandia (50, 51, 57) have focused on EEP. We 
have introduced the measurement of spiking action potentials from 
filamentous mycelia to control mobile robots. As the field grows, 
standards for comparison (signaling, hardware, wetware, organisms) 
will be important to measure progress.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fungal culture protocols
We cultured the fungi in sterilized conditions using a biosafety cab-
inet (BSC). To achieve a contamination-­free and pure fungiculture, 
maintaining a sterilized condition is crucial. The fungal culture is a 
multistep process [see fig. S1 (steps 1 to 7)].
Medium preparation and sterilization
In our fungal model, we used potato dextrose agar (PDA). For me-
dium preparation, we used a recipe of 3.6% (w/v) PDA powder and 
mixed in deionized water in an Erlenmeyer flask. We covered the 
flask with aluminum foil to prevent it from spilling. After preparing 
the liquid medium, we then mixed it using a magnetic stirrer for 
15 min. We sterilized the medium in an autoclave for 45 min us-
ing 30-­min sterilization and 15-­min cooling cycles at 34.47 kPa 
and 120°C. We also used autoclave tape to ensure that the medium 
was completely sterilized (fig. S1, steps 1 to 4).
Medium transfer
After the autoclaving cycle finished, we let the flask cool for 20 to 
30 min until we could comfortably hold it. We then poured the me-
dium into polystyrene circular-­shaped large [150 mm (diameter, D) 
by 15 mm (height, H)]– and small [60 mm (D) by 15 mm (H)]–size 
petri dishes under the BSC. We regulated the amount of the medium 
in the petri dishes using a weighing scale so that the fungi could eas-
ily grow over the electrodes. For example, for small petri dishes, we 
used 14.5 to 15 g, and, for large petri dishes, we used 50 to 54 g of 
agar. Furthermore, we waited at least 4 hours for gelation of the me-
dium in petri dishes (fig. S1, step 5).
Fungal inoculation
After gelling medium in petri dishes, we started inoculating the 
fungi. We first purchased a P. eryngii (king oyster) mushroom kit 
from Amazon.com (root mushroom farm) and then grew it until it 
produced a fruiting body. We inoculated our first culture from the 
fruiting body. We began the process for fungal inoculation by spray-
ing disinfectant in the BSC and turning on the filter for 15 min. We then 
sprayed 70% (v/v) ethanol and wiped the BSC again. Then, we put 
medium plates in the BSC as well as a live fruiting body. We steril-
ized a scalpel using 100% ethanol and directly exposed it to fire from 
a burner. We then cut small pieces from the inner side of the fruiting 
body to ensure a clean surface, transferred them into a medium 
plate, and repeated the process for multiple petri dishes. Last, we 
closed the petri dish lids and wrapped them with parafilm to pre-
vent any further contamination (fig. S1, step 6).
Fungal incubation
We stored multiple plates in an incubator at room temperature. We 
waited for 3 weeks and 5 weeks for the mycelia to grow fully in the 
small and large petri dishes, respectively (fig. S1, step 7).
Subcultures
We used a clean culture as a master plate and regularly inoculated 
several plates for subcultures following the same procedure (steps 1 
to 7). We continued to transfer the fungus to freshly prepared me-
dium every month to keep it alive and vigorous for future studies.
3D-­printed mycelium scaffold
Scaffold hardware design
To provide a substrate for mycelia and an electrical interface with our 
mechatronic system, we designed and 3D-­printed a mycelium culture 
plate using a Carbon M1 printer and polyurethane materials (RPU, 
Carbon Inc.; Fig. 1, B and C). These plates feature three electrode 
inputs (E1, E2, and EGND; MN4022D10S#, Spes Medica, Italy; see 
Fig. 1B). The scaffold consisted of a petri dish containing agar medi-
um, freshly inoculated mycelia, three electrodes (E1, E2, and EGND), 
connectors to hold the electrodes, an antivibration electrometric pad, 
and a casing to secure the petri dish. The casing replicated a petri dish 
and was precisely designed to position the electrodes. For electrode 
attachment, we used a Luer lock mechanism to enable easy attachment 
and detachment of plug and socket connectors. The electrodes were 
integrated into the socket connector and secured with dental cement 
to prevent internal movement. Two electrodes (E1 and E2) were posi-
tioned in parallel, 10 mm from the sides and 10 and 11 mm from the 
base of the petri dishes, respectively. The EGND electrode was placed at 
180° and 1 mm from the base of the petri dish (as shown in Fig. 1C).

Fabrication
The scaffold fabrication involved three major steps: initially, creating 
a computer-­aided design 3D model using SOLIDWORKS software 
(SolidWorks Corp., Dassault Systèms); subsequently, converting the 
3D models into .stl file format before printing; and lastly, engaging 
in 3D printing and postprocessing. In our setup, we divided the cas-
ing in half for easy integration and 3D-­printed all its components 
using a Carbon M1 printer (Carbon Inc.) with rigid polyurethane 
(RPU 70, 1.7-­GPa tensile modulus, 30% elongation at break).
Casing and electrode integration
To prepare for measuring fungal action potential signals, we inte-
grated all electrodes and mycelium plates with the casing. We placed 
a 3D-­printed elastomeric antivibration pad with a thickness of 1 mm 
on the base of the scaffold before integrating the petri dish. We at-
tached the petri dish to the casing using Teets cold cure dental ce-
ment (Co-­ORAL-­ITE Dental Mfg. Co.) and waited for over 30 min 
until they were fully bonded. Then, we made small holes for the 
electrodes using a 1-­mm metal rod heated with a burner flame and 
passed it through the plug holders’ holes to ensure that they were 
concentric. We inserted the electrodes into the socket connectors 
and locked them with dental cement. After the electrodes were fully 
integrated into the connectors, we inserted them into the plug con-
nectors and locked them using a Luer lock mechanism. Last, we 
added paper tape around the connectors and electrode wires to en-
sure that there was no movement (refer to Fig. 1, B and C).
Fungal signal recording setup
In our experimental design, we used twisted subdermal needle elec-
trodes made of stainless steel, lead wire from Cu/Sn with polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) coating, and a connector with CuZn with PVC jack-
et. Specifically, we used electrodes of 220-­mm length and 0.4-­mm 
diameter (Spes Medica, Italy, intraoperative monitoring neurodiag-
nostic electrodes). To record signals, we used a PicoLog 24-­bit ADC 
high-­resolution data acquisition system (DAQ) (Pico Technology, 
16 S/s, four digital I/O channel maximum of ±2500 mV and mini-
mum of ±39 mV, and 16 single-­ended voltage/8 differential voltage 
inputs). We connected the DAQ to PicoLog software and used three 
electrodes: two for differential input and one for ground input with 
±39 mV channel at a 10 S/s (<500-­nV resolution) setting.
To protect against unexpected vibrations and other interference 
such as electromagnetic impact, we built a large Faraday cage and 
isolated the recording system. We constructed a large Faraday cage 
(1 m by 1 m by 1.5 m) using a heavy metal block. The Faraday cage 
was covered by copper mesh from all sides and wrapped with black 
cloth to block out light. To prevent high-­amplitude mechanical 
noise, we used buckets filled with sand at the four corners of the 
Faraday cage. To ensure long periods of experiments, we minimized 
the opening of the Faraday cage (refer to Fig. 2B and fig. S4, A and B).
Fungal signal analysis method
We stored the large datasets of fungal signals in CSV format, repre-
senting action potential values in microvolts versus the number of 
samples, for analysis. We classified any fungal signal below 5 μV as 
noise and excluded it from further analysis. For algorithm develop-
ment, we used Python (version 3.9.13) with the SciPy signal library. 
Our focus included specific time periods: a single 14th day for a 
5-­hour dataset from the small plate and 48-­hour datasets collected 
every 7 days from both small and large plates. We sampled the data 
at 30-­s intervals, a rate sufficient to observe at least one or two peaks. 
After sampling, we applied the Savitzky-­Golay filter to remove elec-
tronic noise and smooth any signals below 5 μV. We also defined the 
baseline potential and prominence (P), setting P = 10 μV for all 
analyses of fungal signals, addressing both positive and negative 
spikes. The data were then imported into our developed code, and 
we analyzed eight signal characteristics, as discussed in the section 
Signal processing and analysis.
To identify the peaks, we used the find_peaks and peak_widths 
functions, using a predefined prominence. The find_peaks function 
estimated the signal peak and height between depolarization and 
repolarization from the baseline, as the peak_widths function calcu-
lated the width, representing the time between depolarization and 
repolarization at 80% of the spike height. Subsequently, we created 
arrays for time, peak, height, and width over the given duration as 
shown through a flow chart in fig. S6. On the basis of these data, we 
generated histograms for signal peak, height, and width over the 
48-­hour period. In addition, we counted the number of peaks and 
normalized it by the sampling time. We also plotted the action 
potentials versus time, height versus width, height versus time, and 
width versus time. The results are presented in Fig. 2 (C to G) and 
figs. S7 to S15. Refer to the Small and large petri dish mycelium scaf-
fold weekly data analysis section in the Supplementary Methods for 
further discussion of the results.
UV light stimulation setup
For UV sensing, we prepared the same setup as used and discussed 
in the Fungal signal recording setup section. Once the mycelium 
plate and recording setup were completed, we proceeded to set up 
the UV light source. We used an OmniCure versatile UV mercury 
lamp (OmniCure S1500 Spot UV curing system, 435-­nm Excelitas 
Technologies Corp.) equipped with a long flexible optical fiber cable 
and a collimator (fig. S16A).
The OmniCure lamp was placed outside the Faraday cage, and 
the optical fiber cable with collimator was clamped onto a variable 
height stand using a gripper. We ensured that the UV lens was set up 
to irradiate the scaffold surface perpendicularly. In addition, we used 
a UV shield for our safety and protection. As a control experiment, 
we used an agar (PDA) plate without any mycelium inoculation. 
During the UV sensing experiment, we performed several tests to 
examine the effects of variable exposure height, variable exposure 
intensity, and variable exposure time and repeated each set of ex-
periments at least seven times.
Variable intensity exposure
We conducted an experiment to study the effect of UV radiation on 
fungi by increasing the UV power intensity from 0.1 to 1 W cm−2. 
Throughout the experiment, we maintained a constant height of the 
UV source at 12 cm and irradiated the fungi with UV light for 2 s. 
We waited for 2 min between each illumination event to determine 
the optimal duration of illumination and to minimize the influence 
of heat emitted by the light source on the fungus. To ensure pre-
cise intensity adjustments, we carefully adjusted the position of the 
light source.
Variable height exposure
We conducted variable height tests at an intensity of 0.1 W cm−2, 
following similar steps as the variable intensity test. However, in this 
case, we varied the distance between the mycelium plate and colli-
mator of the light source. The height was adjusted from 12 to 20 cm

with 2-­cm increments. The purpose of using a low intensity was to 
minimize any potential damage to the fungus during the experiment.
Variable time exposure
We conducted a time duration test to assess the effect of increasing 
durations of irradiation on fungi. We started with an initial duration 
of 2 s and gradually increased it up to 12 s. In addition, we tested 
different time intervals between illuminations. On the basis of the 
results of these experiments, we determined that an interval of 
2 min between each irradiation event provided optimal conditions. 
Furthermore, throughout the experiments, we maintained a consis-
tent height of 12 cm and intensity of 0.1 W cm−2.
Mycelium-­directed robot control method
To enable real-­time control, we designed an on-­demand control al-
gorithm that performs all signal processing in real time. The algo-
rithm consists of three main substeps: real-­time data acquisition, 
real-­time data computation, and real-­time control signal generation, 
as illustrated in Fig. 3C, fig. S18A, and movie S1. This process in-
volves continuously reading the mycelium signals and saving the 
data every 30 s. The algorithm then analyzes the first 30 s of data, 
extracting peak width and height information to generate control 
signals and reprogram the MCU in situ. We created three program 
files that were sequentially executed from the command prompt: the 
data acquisition file, followed by the data computation file, and last-
ly the robot control file. The detailed algorithm flow chart can be 
found in fig. S18A.
For real-­time data acquisition, we used a PicoLog DAQ, along 
with a custom-­built Python program (version 3.9.13) that enabled 
us to sample the mycelium signal and process it. In Python, we used 
the Pico SDK library to configure and access the Picolog device.
The voltage range and conversion time (sampling rate) were set 
to ±39 mV and 100 ms (10 S s−1), respectively, to accurately record 
the mycelium signal. We applied a conversion formula provided by 
the PicoLog datasheet, as shown in Eq. 6, to interpret the record-
ed signal
 
Here, ADC Valueraw refers to the raw data obtained from the 
fungi, ADC Valuemax represents the maximum ADC count, and 
Vmax denotes the voltage range of the dataset. Because our objective 
involved not only reading the data but also processing it for control 
purposes, we saved fungal data points in a text file every 30 s at a 
sampling rate of 10 S/s, resulting in a total of 300 data points per file. 
Depending on the experimental requirements, we saved text files for 
different durations in real time from 10 to 60 min.
For real-­time computation, we began analyzing the signal prop-
erties, specifically peak width and height. To ensure stability in the 
membrane potential, we discarded the initial 30-­s data. We imple-
mented Python code (version 3.9.13) using the SciPy signal library, 
as discussed in the Fungal signal analysis method section. By de-
fining the baseline potential (baseline) and setting a prominence 
threshold of 10 μV, we detected fungal spikes above this threshold, 
including both positive and negative spikes. To smoothen the signal 
below 5 μV, we applied the Savitzky-­Golay filter. The find_peaks and 
peak_widths commands were used to estimate spike height and 
width, respectively. We reported a 10-­min signal with detection of 
fungal signal in fig. S18B and in situ process in movie S1.
For real-­time control signal generation, we provided fungal 
height and width information from the 30-­s text file to Arduino 
for robot control, continuously updating this information every 
30 s using the saved text file. We also developed robot control in 
Python and interfaced Python with Arduino. We used the pyFir-
mata library (version 1.1.0), which enabled access to the Arduino 
microcontroller and allowed for real-­time reprogramming with 
the fungal information.
Soft legged robot design and fabrication
We fabricated a starfish robot as a monolithic structure through a 
hybrid approach, using polyurethane chemistry–based soft and rig-
id resins to create the soft monolithic robot. Our process involved 
three steps. First, we designed 3D models of the robot’s components 
using SOLIDWORKS software and converted them into .stl files for 
printing. Next, we printed individual components, such as actuators 
and the base body. Then, we assembled these components at the un-
cured stage and subjected them to thermal baking. This process, be-
cause of the shared chemistry of the soft and rigid materials, allowed 
for polymerization between the heterogeneous materials, resulting 
in a single body. This means that we can produce a monolithic ro-
botic structure with a hybrid material approach, achieving com-
plex soft robotic structures—in this case, a monolithic starfish-­like 
soft robot.
The dimensions of the actuator are a length of 62.7 mm, a base 
width of 25.5 mm, a top width of 10 mm, and a height of 16 mm. 
The central body with a side length of l1 = 30 mm and a height of 
h1 = 25.5 mm; the plug scaffold connector measures l2 = 30 mm by 
h2 = 15 mm, and the socket scaffold connector measures l3 = 30 mm 
by h3 = 10 mm. For additional details on the mycelial scaffold setup, 
refer to the 3D-­printed mycelium scaffold section.
We used a high-­resolution digital light synthesis printer (Carbon 
M1, Carbon Inc.) to print the components. Last, we assembled the 
printed parts by using thermal baking and fastening techniques such 
as glue, screws, and nuts. We built the robot with a multimaterial 
approach, soft and rigid. We used UV-­curable silicone elastomer 
(SIL30, tensile modulus of 3 MPa, elongation at break of 350%, Car-
bon Inc.) for soft components such as the leg actuators, scaffold plug 
connector, soft pad, and soft foot (Fs). Conversely, we used RPU 70 
(tensile modulus of 1.7 GPa, elongation at break of 30%, Carbon 
Inc.) for rigid components, including the central base, barbed tube 
connector, rigid feet (Fr1, Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4), and scaffold socket con-
nector. The multimaterial and multistep 3D-­printing method is dis-
cussed in the Soft legged robot 3D printing fabrication procedure 
section in the Supplementary Methods.
Pressure sensor integrated soft robot for signal I/O 
mapping setup
In the soft robot setup, we used the same electronic components and 
circuits as described in the Soft legged robot electronics section in 
the Supplementary Methods. In addition, we incorporated an ana-
log pressure sensor (SSCDANN150PGAA5, 1034.21 kPa, vented 
gauge, 0.5 to 4.5 V, 8-­DIP) from Honeywell Sensing and Productiv-
ity Solutions (digikey.com). The sensor, with three pins (Vsupply, Vout, 
and ground), was connected between the robot’s inlet and valve out-
let using a T-­shaped barbed connector (refer to fig. S20). To read the 
data from the sensor, we used an additional Arduino. The Vout pin 
was connected to an analog read pin (A0), Vsupply to 5 V, and ground 
to the ground pin. We captured the data in the serial monitor at the

same sampling rate as the mycelium signal (10 Hz) and saved the 
pressure data in an Excel file.
Untethered wheeled robot design and fabrication
We constructed the untethered wheeled robot in the same manner 
as the tethered soft robot except we used a fused deposition modeling 
(FDM) printer for most of the components and assembled them 
with screws and nuts. We used an Ultimaker S5, an extrusion-­based 
FDM printer from Ultimaker USA Inc., to print the robot base, bat-
tery support structure (first and second floor), fungi, and datalogger 
tray (third floor). These components were printed using polylactic 
acid filaments in black and transparent colors sourced from Maker-
Bot Industries LLC, with a tensile modulus of 3.3 GPa and an 
elongation at break of 7.8%. For the motor brackets, wheel-­motor 
connectors, and VIS support structure, we used urethane methacry-
late (UMA 90), a resin with a tensile modulus of 1.7 GPa and an 
elongation at break of 30%, sourced from Carbon Inc., and printed 
them using the Carbon M1 printer.
We initiated the fabrication process by 3D-printing the motor brack-
ets, wheel connectors, and the robot base. For this purpose, we used 
four shock-­resistant thermoplastic rubber (TPE) tread hard polypro-
pylene core wheels sourced from McMaster-­Carr, with a diameter of 
12.7 cm and a width of 2.2 cm. In addition, we selected four dc motors 
for motion, which we securely fixed into brackets and then connected 
to the wheels using 3D-­printed connectors. We fastened them in place 
using screws and nuts. Subsequently, we attached an X-­shaped frame to 
the brackets both to prevent tilting and to house the battery pack.
Upon finalizing the wheel-­motor drive chassis, we firmly affixed it 
to a rectangular base measuring 320 cm by 230 cm. After that, we con-
nected the VIS module and affixed antivibration foam rubber mats 
sourced from XCEL via Amazon.com to the robot base. These mats 
were composed of Neoprene foam with pressure-­sensitive adhesive, 
measuring 152.5 mm (length, L) by 152.5 mm (width, W) by 6.25 mm 
(H). The VIS module was composed of four 3D-­printed fixtures and 
four shock-­absorbing, vibration-­damping disk-­shaped pads purchased 
from Sonvera Pads via Amazon.com. An attachment was used to es-
tablish the connection between the VIS module and the tray.
Next, we securely positioned the minicomputer, motor control 
circuit, and MCU on a sponge mat embedded base. Subsequently, 
we proceeded to 3D print the tray using an FDM printer with di-
mensions of 410 cm (L) by 300 cm (W) by 5 cm (H). To create com-
partments, we included a partition within the tray. The connectors 
of the VIS module were then attached to the four corners of the tray 
and tightly secured using antivibration pads, using a peg and hole 
joint. We divided the partition into sections, dedicating one section 
to PicoLog wiring and the other section to the 3D-­printed mycelial 
scaffold. We show the complete robot schematic and assembled pro-
totype in fig. S22 (A to D).
Encoder-­integrated dc motor for signal I/O mapping setup
For the wheeled robot test, we used a motor encoder setup. We 
used a micro metal geared brushed motor (6 V, 31 RPM, 100 mA, 
12 kg·cm, 1.6 A) and a quadrature encoder with a hall effect sensor 
and magnets (12 CPR, 2.7 to 18 V) sourced from pololu.com. The 
motor was fixed on a 3D-­printed stand. The motor control circuit is 
the same as described in the wheeled robot control section. Further-
more, we used a single motor using the same configuration but added 
an extra Arduino to read the motor’s output signals from the encoder. 
The encoder had four pins: two for Vsupply and GND and two output 
pins (A and B) for digital reading. We connected the Vsupply and 
ground pins to the Arduino’s 5 V and GND pins, respectively, and the 
A and B pins to digital input pins. We read the data in the serial mon-
itor, saved it in an Excel file, and then plotted the mycelium-­directed 
input signals and encoder output signals together at the same sam-
pling rate. The complete circuit diagram is shown in fig. S23B.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the mean values and SDs (± SD) for all electrical 
measurements. For example, in our weekly analysis, we used 48-­hour 
datasets, each containing 1,728,000 samples, from a total pool of 
25,920,000 samples. We conducted skew-­normal distribution anal-
ysis on these datasets, estimating both the mean and the SD of 
the detected peak probability distributions. Similarly, in the light-­
stimulation experiments, we repeated the light stimulation at least 
seven times (n = 7) under identical conditions and then calculated 
the mean and SD of all detected peak values.
