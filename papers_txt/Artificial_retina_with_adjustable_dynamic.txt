SUMMARY
With the development of artiﬁcial intelligence, it is important to obtain high-dimensional information of optical
sensors from the device level in the intelligent era, especially visual dynamic features. It is difﬁcult for the elec-
tronic vision system based on conventional photodetectors to capture these dynamic features. Based on the
transient light response mechanism of the photosensitive protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR), an artiﬁcial retina
with dynamic recognition ability has been developed. Inspired by the optical regulator cells in the human
retina, we used carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and micropore/nanopore structures for controlling the photocur-
rent duration time (PDT). In addition, different dynamic recognition modes and applications were obtained by
adjusting the PDT. By adjusting the PDT, the artiﬁcial retina demonstrated adaptive frame extraction based
on its difference perception capability and dynamic trajectory capture based on its visual persistence
capability.
INTRODUCTION
The perception of dynamic differences1 in vision is crucial for or-
ganisms to react quickly to changes in the external environ-
ment.2 Sensing devices that can capture visual dynamic features
provide an efﬁcient, natural, and integrated design solution for
realizing perceptual interaction. Dynamic vision has two key
characteristics: difference perception3,4 and visual persistence
ability.5 Difference perception refers to the ability to recognize
differences between consecutive frames, while visual persis-
tence refers to the ability to remember a series of individual
frames to perceive continuous motion. A sensing device with
inherent dynamic vision capabilities has applications in motion
sensing, such as navigation systems for drones and self-driving
cars, and in security and various environmental monitoring sys-
tems. The ability to generate output directly based on changes
instead of a series of images can reduce the data processing
overhead required for these applications.
THE BIGGER PICTURE
The function of vision systems can be classiﬁed into two main categories: the detec-
tion of objects and the detection of motions. For biological vision systems such as the human retina, there is a
built-in mechanism in the optical regulator cells for detecting motion features. However, for most imaging de-
vices like a video camera, the motion detection is done by capturing and comparing the static frames, which
can be data intensive. Here, we present an artiﬁcial retina with a built-in ability for difference perception and
visual persistence. Bacteriorhodopsin is used as the photoelectric response generator. CNTs and micropore/
nanopore structures are used as the photoelectric response regulator. The artiﬁcial retina can realize adap-
tive frame extraction by responding to sudden movements and can also capture moving object trajectory
based on the visual persistence effect.

Most conventional artiﬁcial retinas,6–9 combined with neural
networks, could recognize static objects,10,11 such as light infor-
mation, faces, numbers, and gestures (see Note S7). However,
devices made of conventional inorganic/organic materials main-
tained a consistent level of photoelectric response under contin-
uous light (Table S1), which makes it difﬁcult to adjust the photo-
current duration time (PDT). This is in contrast to the fatigue
property of the optic nerve, which naturally decreases its
response to a persistent stimulus. Dynamic perception requires
optical sensors to process complex images,12,13 which can be
realized by adjusting the PDT of the device. As an optoelectronic
material with material stability14 and biocompatibility,15 bacterio-
rhodopsin (bR) performs a controllable proton transport process
from intracellular to extracellular under light stimulation, leading
to the generation of a transient photocurrent.16 The generation of
photocurrent is based on the change in light intensity, but the
photocurrent decays under continuous illumination, which is
similar to the visual persistence or fatigue in the human vision
system. This mechanism is different from conventional optoelec-
tronic materials, allowing the adjustment of photocurrent dura-
tion time, which is more conducive to applications in biomimetic
vision.
The dynamic recognition ability of bR-based artiﬁcial retinal
devices is related to the PDT. For the human retina, electrochem-
ical signals produced by photoreceptors are regulated by vari-
ous optical regulator cells. In our system, this can be mimicked
using carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which have good biocompati-
bility and can be combined with bR to achieve electron-proton
coupling transport function. Moreover, the integration of micro-
pore/nanopore structures can also affect proton transport and
extend the PDT.
In this work, we present an artiﬁcial retina comprising CNTs/
bR with adjustable difference perception and visual persistence.
By mimicking the functional aspects of the biological retina, we
use bR as the photoelectric response generator. In addition,
CNTs and micropore/nanopore structures are used as the pho-
toelectric response regulator. This enables adjustable device
PDT modes, which are correlated with dynamic capture capa-
bility. Difference perception-based adaptive frame extraction
simulation was conducted with integrating artiﬁcial intelligence
algorithms, and visual persistence-based dynamic trajectory
capture simulation was performed to record object motion tra-
jectories within image frames.
RESULTS
Device design and operation principles
Figure 1A shows the structure of the human retina.17 Signals in
the retina propagate from the photoreceptors to the bipolar cells
and then to the ganglion cells.18 First, photoreceptors convert
light signals into electrochemical signals. Second, the bipolar
cells receive the signal and transmit it to the ganglion cells and
down to the optic nerve. During this process, the bipolar cells
serve as regulators of the light response, which is done by the
CNTs in the artiﬁcial retina. Meanwhile, the horizontal cells and
amacrine cells both affect the signal transmission by inﬂuencing
other cells on the signal transmission chain. This can be referred
to as a type of structure regulation, which is accomplished in the
artiﬁcial retina by the designed micropore/nanopore structures.
To realize the design concept, we studied the effects of trans-
mission regulation and structure regulation on the bR-based
photoreceptor device.
There are two important characteristics of bR. One is that it
generates photocurrent when sufﬁcient light intensity change is
felt, and the other is that the current decreases with time under
continuous light stimulation. These correspond to the two impor-
tant characteristics of difference perception and visual persis-
tence in the dynamic recognition of the human visual system.
The PDT, which is directly related to the photocycle,19 has an ef-
fect on both properties. To explore the connection between the
PDT and the dynamic recognition characteristics, we studied the
photocycle and the PDT of the bR and the hybrid CNTs/bR.
The photocycle model,14 proposed by Norbert Hampp, dem-
onstrates that the photocycle process of bR is accompanied
by the transport of protons. The asynchronous occurrence of
bR release and absorption of protons leads to a time difference
dt1 in the equilibrium of the membrane potential, resulting in a
transient photocurrent (see Figure 1B). The protons delivered
to one side are bound to form a proton concentration gradient
in the external solution. This implies that an equilibration time
dt2 would affect both the PDT and the photocycle of the bR mole-
cule. Thus, the following PDT formula for equilibrium time (i.e.,
proton transport rate) is as follows:
PDTffðdt1; dt2Þ
(Equation 1)
By adjusting the two key parameters of dt1 and dt2, we expect
to realize the regulation of PDT and then the regulation of dy-
namic recognition ability.
The

can
be
accelerated
by
adjusting the concentration of CNTs.15,20 CNTs, as low-
dimensional nanocarbon-based materials with a carrier mobility
of 20 cm2/V $ s,21 should enable transmission acceleration for
proton transport by carrier coupling. Transient absorption tests
are performed to verify the composite effect (as shown in
Figures 1C and 1D; the testing procedure can be found in Note
S1). The addition of CNTs, which leads to faster decay of the in-
termediate M-state lifetime, indicates a shorter time difference
dt1 in the equilibrium of the membrane potential and a
shorter PDT.
From the perspective of proton equilibrium in the external solu-
tion, micropore/nanopore structures could be introduced to con-
trol the equilibrium time by limiting proton transport. As shown in
Figure 1E, the pore aperture affects the time for the gradient to
reach equilibrium. Smaller pores allow fewer protons to pass
per unit time, which makes the equilibrium time dt2 longer, result-
ing in a longer PDT. The above mechanisms provide the theoret-
ical basis for the regulation of PDT, which is conducive to our
further device fabrication and application research.
Device preparation and characterization
Before making the artiﬁcial retina, bR was prepared and charac-
terized. The bR suspension was prepared using techniques
detailed in the methods section.22 The resulting bR is stable
against high temperature,14,23 high salt concentration,24 and
other extreme environmental conditions.25

The artiﬁcial retina is composed of two materials: bR as a pho-
toelectric response generator and CNTs as a photoelectric
response regulator. The bR suspension was mixed with CNTs
to enhance the carrier mobility26 for regulating the proton trans-
port process.27 Figure 2A shows the preparation process of the
sensing unit for the artiﬁcial retina, which consists of the hybrid
CNTs/bR ﬁlm. The bR suspension is mixed with the CNT solution
using ultrasound. Then, the hybrid suspension is dropped onto
the surface of the indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass, which
acts as an electrode for signal readout, and the hybrid CNTs/bR
ﬁlm (ﬁlm size: 2 3 2 mm) is prepared by the induced evaporation
method28 (see more in methods). Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests are per-
formed to distinguish the hybrid CNTs/bR ﬁlm from the pure
bR ﬁlm in Figures 2B–2E. According to the AFM images
(Figures 2B and 2C), the hybrid ﬁlm has a lower roughness value
(Rq = 17.6 nm) compared to the pure ﬁlm (Rq = 72.6 nm), which
indicates that the hybrid CNTs/bR ﬁlm is ﬂatter and more

uniform. The SEM images in Figures 2D and 2E also show that
the surface of the bR ﬁlm is not as uniform as that of the hybrid
CNTs/bR ﬁlm. The hydrophilicity is different on the two sides of
the bR membrane, while the surface of CNTs is hydrophobic,29
resulting in a more orderly bR orientation during evaporation-
induced deposition of the hybrid ﬁlm.30 Previous studies31,32
have shown that more ordered bR orientation enhances the
magnitude and stability of optoelectronic devices based on bR.
The photoelectric response of hybrid CNTs/bR ﬁlm was
tested in a polydimethylsiloxane-based solution chamber and
a xenon lamp (Beijing China Education Au-Light Technology;
type: CEL/HXF300-T3). The test was performed with a three-
electrode system using an electrochemical workstation, an
ITO deposited with hybrid CNTs/bR ﬁlm (as a working elec-
trode), and a pure ITO (as an auxiliary electrode and reference
electrode), which were inserted at each end of the chamber.
One side of the chamber is capable of integrating a single
pore with a chosen aperture depending on the requirement of
the application (shown in Figure 2F, and more details about
the tests can be found in Notes S2 and S3). Under the dual ef-
fect of CNTs and aperture size, the PDT of the generated
photocurrent can not only be ﬁnely adjusted in a small range
(approximately tens of milliseconds) but also in a large range
macroscopically. The occurrence of this regulation is condu-
cive to the acquisition and adjustment of difference perception
and visual persistence characteristics.
Tuning the PDT
Unlike conventional photodetectors, which generate a stable
and continuous photoelectric response level with light, our artiﬁ-
cial retina produces a spike-like pulse signal with a short PDT for
capturing dynamic features. To further explore the ability of the
device, different material composites and device structure de-
signs were used to assess their impact on PDT. The reference
PDT value of the device is deﬁned as the duration time for the
photocurrent to decay from peak to 5%, and the speciﬁc calcu-
lation method is detailed in Note S4.
Figure 3A illustrates the difference in the generated photocur-
rent with/without CNTs at different apertures and their effects on
the PDT. The hybrid of the bR and the CNTs shortens the PDT
from 100 to 83 ms. The PDTs of hybrid CNTs/bR ﬁlm have
a faster decay rate compared to those of the unmixed ﬁlm for
all aperture sizes. For different aperture sizes, the PDT obtains
an adjustment range from 100 ms to 5.4 s. Through structure
regulation and transmission regulation, the PDT can be opti-
mized. Additional factors that affect the photocurrent are dis-
cussed in Note S4, which includes light intensity, the concentra-
tion of the bR suspension, and the concentration of the testing
solution.
To study the effect of the amount of CNTs on the PDT, sets of
different ratios (bR: CNTs = 100:1, 50:1, 20:1, 10:1, and pure bR
ﬁlm) were made under three different aperture sizes. The variable
trend of the PDT with incremental CNTs/bR ratios at different

aperture sizes is shown in Figure 3B. As expected, the PDT
shows a downward trend with the incremental CNTs/bR ratios.
In addition, the descending gradient shows different degrees
of slowing, and the PDT eventually reaches a stable value. As
shown in Figure 3C, the data conﬁrm the inﬂuence of CNTs
and aperture on PDT.
The inﬂuence of light intensity on PDT is depicted in Figure 3D.
As the light intensity increases from 24 to 220 mW/cm2 (tested
under a single micropore), the PDT of the device (represented
by the red pillar) increases until saturation. As the light intensity
increases, more bR molecules are excited to transport protons,
leading to an increase in the proton quantity and prolongation of
the equilibrium time. When the light intensity increases to a
certain level, fewer bR molecules remain in an inactive state,
leading to a slower increase in the number of transported pro-
tons. Meanwhile, the incremental hybrid CNTs/bR ratio main-
tains a shortening effect on the PDT under different light inten-
sities, indicating that the regulation effect of CNTs on the PDT
is relatively independent, repeatable, and stable.
As discussed above, the PDT of the device can be adjusted by
mixing CNTs or integrating micropore/nanopore. The processes
of making device array and signal extraction are relatively com-
plex, we designed two simulation experiments to demonstrate
the dynamic vision perception function of the device in slow
PDT and fast PDT mode.
Simulated difference perception of the artiﬁcial retina
To demonstrate the difference perception capability of the artiﬁ-
cial retina, we designed a simulation experiment based on the
fast PDT mode of the device. Shown in Figure 4A, after the mix-
ing of CNTs, the PDT of the device can be reduced greatly, re-
sulting in a narrow spike signal (83 ms) for signal sampling.
This sampled signal is generated only when the intensity of
incoming light changes signiﬁcantly. In our simulation experi-
ment (see data and code availability for more detail), the device
array fully receives the light from the video frames. When the
change in light intensity perceived by any sensor in the array ex-
ceeds a certain threshold, the device generates a pulse signal,
and the corresponding frame will be extracted. When the ex-
tracted dataset is used to train the machine learning algorithm,
a good recognition model is acquired, showing the effectiveness
of the adaptive frame extraction method.
When analyzing dynamic information by traditional photo-
electric sensors, the average frame extraction method is often
adopted, which extracts a ﬁxed number of frames (B) with a
ﬁxed interval (A/B) from a video with a total of A frames.

Because this approach does not adjust to the content of the
video dynamically, it can result in data redundancy and exces-
sive computing if B is too large, and misses important features
if B is too small. In comparison, a dynamic vision sensor would
only output signal based on changes between frames and
avoid both of the shortcomings of average frame extraction.
Simulated device arrays (see Note S5) are used to achieve
adaptive capture of frames with dynamic changes as the
photocurrent pulse is generated, which means the frame data
will only be extracted when the changes between frames reach
a certain threshold Vsth. The Vsth represents the degree of
change in light intensity. This process of frame extraction is
similar to that of a visual system to distinguish fast-changing
objects, both of which are able to perceive moving objects
against a static background.
Grayscale and image segmentation processing are used in
continuous video frames, and the gray value indicates the in-
tensity of light in each segmented area of the image as
perceived by the artiﬁcial retina unit. Each frame of the video
is processed into a numeric matrix (grayscale values, i rows,
and j columns; see more about this pooling process in Note
S5). Then, as shown in Figure 4A, the ﬁrst frame is taken as
the base frame, and the next frame is called the compare
frame; ﬁnally, arithmetic judgment is performed on both by
the operator H (base, compare):
Hðbase; compareÞ = ½baseði;jÞ
 ½compareði;jÞ; i; j = 0; 1; 2; 3.
(Equation 2)
Here, [base](i, j) represents row i, column j of the numeric matrix
on the base frame. In this algorithm, the adaptive frame extrac-
tion method is achieved by the CNTs/bR photocurrent response
caused by the change in light intensity. When the change in illu-
mination intensity is enough to cause the CNTs/bR artiﬁcial
retina to generate a light response current greater than Vsth,
the CNTs/bR artiﬁcial retina generates a signal. The addition of
CNTs modiﬁes the width of this signal by shortening the PDT,
so it can be used as a switch for spike signal sampling. This in-
dicates that only the frames with large changes will be extracted.
The magnitude of the changes depends on the moving speed of
the car, and the proposed method implements the function of

adaptive frame extraction. These extracted frames can pro-
vide important features for the displacement prediction of the
car. Minor position changes (e.g., background changes, small
displacements of the white car) are not retained during data pro-
cessing since the mapped matrix [output](i, j) is less than Vsth.
Therefore, the adaptive frame extraction method avoids the in-
formation redundancy caused by excessive frame extraction,
while retaining sufﬁcient feature data to facilitate the prediction
of subsequent neural networks (read more in Note S5).
A composite model of YOLOv533 and long short-term mem-
ory34 was used to identify and predict the current position and
next position of the vehicle, achieving 0.965 mAP@0.5 (i.e., a
meanaverageprecision of96.5%underanintersectionover union
R 0.5). Test results can be found in Figures S6, S7, Note S5, and
Video S1. Shown in Figure 4B, the red box represents the current
position of the white car and was marked as ‘‘car,’’ and the blue
box represents the predicted next position of the white car.
Simulated visual persistence of the artiﬁcial retina
Visual persistence is another property of dynamic vision. By
introducing micropore/nanopore structures, the device can
achieve a slow PDT mode, thus demonstrating visual persis-
tence capability. Shown in Figure 5A, a moving point was
observed by our artiﬁcial retina. The results demonstrate that a
fading trajectory was captured. Figure 5B explains the mecha-
nism of visual persistence acquired by the proposed CNTs/bR
artiﬁcial retina array. When inducing light irradiates a certain
unit (or multiple units) of the array and begins to move in a direc-
tion, each newly illuminated unit will obtain an initial current value
based on the photoelectric response of the device and begin to
decay with the decay time t related to PDT. Based on the visual
persistence of the artiﬁcial retina device, dynamic trajectory cap-
ture can be realized. We conducted a simulation experiment on
this, in which a device array (see Note S6) was assumed to cap-
ture the trajectory of the ball. The current values matrix obtained
from the device array can reﬂect the movement trajectory of ob-
jects. For the convenience of observing the phenomenon, the
current value is mapped to the grayscale intensity (more details
on the simulation process and code can be found in Figure S8,
Note S6, and Video S2).
Figure 5C captured a partial frame of a video of a ball move-
ment. At t0, the ball is ready to rebound when it encounters the
ground; at t1, it rebounds in mid-air; at t2, it rebounds to its highest
point; at t3, it falls to the ground and is ready for next bounce; at t4,
it stops rebounding when it encounters the ground; at t5, the ball
rolls forward. In a normal video, a bouncing ball would appear
frozen in any individual frame. In comparison, our artiﬁcial retina
can capture the relative changes between frames in any individual
frame.Asshown inFigure5D,whentheball isinafastmotionstate
(i.e., when a certain velocity threshold is exceeded), the visual
persistence effect can be observed in the frame. This is because
the movement speed of the ball exceeds the current attenuation
speed, allowing for the ability to see residual images of varying
depths in the frame, but not when the ball is stationary or moving
at speeds below the velocity threshold. Furthermore, the dynamic
image capture ability exhibited by the biomimetic retina can be
adjusted through PDT since the ability reﬂects the motion trajec-
tory of the ball over a period that is directly related to PDT.
According to Equation 1, by combining CNTs and adjusting
aperture size, the PDT can be shortened or extended to adjust
the visual characteristics and dynamic image capture ability of
the proposed artiﬁcial retina. As shown in Figure 5E, when the
PDT extends, the decay time of the photoelectric current in-
creases, and the following phenomena can be observed in the
extracted frame: (1) the ball experienced at least one rebound
motion before time t0; (2) the robotic arm starts moving around
time t1; (3) t2 and t3 indicate that the robotic arm moves to the
left, away from the video center; (4) compared to time t4 in Fig-
ure 5C, it can be observed that the ball no longer rebounds; (5)
the ball is moving horizontally to the right at time t5. After regu-
lating the PDT, the ability to capture moving images is adjusted.
Conclusions
In this work, inspired by the structure of the biological retina, a
CNTs/bR hybrid artiﬁcial retina is proposed. By utilizing CNTs
and micropore/nanopore structures, functional biomimicry of
signal regulation is achieved and an adjustable range of PDT
(from 83 ms to 5.4 s) is obtained. Based on different device
PDT modes, various dynamic feature-capturing functions
were realized by the device. Utilizing the ultrafast PDT
mode, a difference perception-based adaptive frame extrac-
tion method was implemented, coupled with artiﬁcial intelli-
gence algorithms, achieving high-quality recognition and pre-
diction models (0.965 mAP@0.5). With the slow PDT mode,
the motion states of objects were obtained, which cannot be
acquired
from
traditional

image
frames. This dynamic recognition capability can solve the
problem of insufﬁcient information acquisition by traditional
sensors; provide comprehensive, multi-dimensional visual in-
formation for vision systems; and realize accurate dynamic
target detection. Moreover, by integrating neural network al-
gorithms, dynamic recognition can be applied in areas such
as object trajectory tracking and prediction. This proposed
CNTs/bR artiﬁcial retina is expected to facilitate more efﬁ-
cient, natural, and integrated perceptual interaction ability in
biomimetic intelligent applications.
