Bacteria-based tumor therapy has recently attracted wide attentions due to its unique cap-
ability in targeting tumors and preferentially colonizing the core area of the tumor. Various
therapeutic genes are also harbored into these engineering bacteria to enhance their anti-
tumor efﬁcacy. However, it is difﬁcult to spatiotemporally control the expression of these
inserted genes in the tumor site. Here, we engineer an ultrasound-responsive bacterium
(URB) which can induce the expression of exogenous genes in an ultrasound-controllable
manner. Owing to the advantage of ultrasound in tissue penetration, an acoustic remote
control of bacterial gene expression can be realized by designing a temperature-actuated
genetic switch. Cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), an important immune regulatory molecule that
plays a signiﬁcant role in tumor immunotherapy, is used to test the system. Our results show
that brief hyperthermia induced by focused ultrasound promotes the expression of IFN-γ
gene, improving anti-tumor efﬁcacy of URB in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides an
alternative strategy for bacteria-mediated tumor immunotherapy.

acteria-mediated tumor therapy has recently attracted wide
attentions as tumor-targeting drug delivery system or as
anti-tumor live agents by themselves because of the char-
acteristics of solid tumors, such as hypoxic, immunosuppressive,
and biochemically unique microenvironment1–3. Compared to
other drug delivery carriers, bacteria-based delivery system
has many advantages, including: (1) bacteria could actively
target
hypoxic,
eutrophic,
and
immunosuppressive
tumor
microenvironment, breaking through the resistance of tumor
blood vessel and the high interstitial pressure and proliferating in
the tumor4,5. This occurs primarily due to reduced immune
surveillance along with the ability of bacteria to grow within the
hypoxic and necrotic tumor core. Because bacteria are both
inherently present and selectively grow within tumors, they
provide a natural platform for the development of programmable
therapeutic delivery vehicles6,7. (2) Also, some engineered bac-
teria can carry therapeutic genes such as encoding PD-L1 single
chain antibody or TNF-a through inserting them into prokaryotic
expression vector, which not only entrusts them with heredit-
ability along with their hosts, but also makes it possible to
combine
multiple
genes
for
maximize
their
anti-tumor
efﬁcacy8–11. (3) More importantly, the introduction of synthetic
biology technologies into these engineered bacteria, such as
promoter engineering, smart genetic circuits greatly improved
their ability to sense and response to disease states of inﬂam-
mation, infection, and to control bacterium growth and gene
expression, largely improving their selective colonization of
tumors and convenient opportunity for tumor drug delivery12–14.
To date, many techniques have been developed for studying
inducible gene expression in bacteria, including chemical induc-
tion, physical stimulation and biological methods15,16. Con-
ventionally, systemically administered chemical inducers are not
speciﬁc to a particular anatomical site. The tumor micro-
environment with high interstitial ﬂuid pressure makes it difﬁcult
for chemical inducers to accumulate to the ideal concentration,
while increasing their doses may possibly bring with potential
side effects17–19. Some biological methods such as the bacterial
quorum sensing system can adjust gene expression in concert
with their population size, making it possible to initiate ther-
apeutic gene expression only when their population density
reaches a threshold level14,16. However, it is difﬁcult for the
biological methods to precisely model gene expression in a spa-
tiotemporally controllable manner, especially in live animals.
Physical induction approaches, such as ray irradiation and light
stimulation, provide high spatiotemporal precision. But the for-
mer is ionizing which may cause damage to the normal tissues in
the irradiation path20, and the latter is limited by the poor
penetration into the deep-seated tumors21. In contrast, ultra-
sound has many advantages in noninvasiveness, safety and tissue
penetration22–24. Importantly, thanks to the thermal effects, the
beam waves excited by ultrasound can be focused into the deep
tissues and precisely and locally elevate the temperature of irra-
diated region through converting the mechanical energy into heat
energy. Thus, it may provide an ideal remote regulation of bac-
terial gene expression when combining with temperature-based
gene control elements25. Our previous studies have used ultra-
sound as a trigger source for drug release in temperature-sensitive
liposomes to achieve targeted controlled release of drugs at tumor
sites26.
The leftward (PL) and rightward (PR) phage lambda promoters
are strong and ﬁnely temperature-regulated promoter elements,
which have been employed for the production of many recom-
binant proteins and peptides in some widely used prokaryotic
expression vectors27. Transcription from either promoter or both
in tandem would be repressed in prokaryotic cells growing at low
temperature (28–30 °C) by the thermolabile cI857 repressor
expressed from the same vector, while a temperature shift to
42–45 °C would rapidly result in the inactivation of cI857
repressor, making it possible to transcribe the appropriately
inserted genes under the promoters and to overproduce their
encoded recombinant proteins. By using of the thermo-regulated
expression system, many heterologous recombinant proteins
and peptides have been successfully induced and produced,
avoiding the use of special media, toxic or expensive chemical
inducers28,29.
In this work, we develop an ultrasound-responsive bacterium
(URB) which can spatiotemporally control the gene expression by
focused ultrasound-induced hyperthermia. In this system, the
IFN-γ or mCherry genes are inserted into the multiple clone site
under PL and PR tandem promoter and further transformed into
the E.coli MG1655 that can accumulate in the hypoxic and
necrotic areas of tumors (Fig. 1). Upon their delivery into the
tumors, focused ultrasound is used to irradiate and heat these
bacteria, triggering the expression of IFN-γ gene and activating
the anti-tumor immune response. The production and secretion
of IFN-γ not only can promote the apoptosis of cancer cells, but
also induce the macrophage polarization from M2 to M1 phe-
notype and the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1, right
panel). Interestingly, plasma IFN-γ secreting from URB also can
polarize the macrophages in murine spleen, enhancing their
antigen presenting effects and producing more CD4+ and CD8+
T cells to inhibit the tumor metastasis and distant tumor growth
(Fig. 1, left panel). Thus, a high spatiotemporal controllable gene
expression strategy in deep tissues is developed through the
remote noninvasive ultrasound in this work.
Results
Hyperthermia and ultrasound triggered gene expression of
ultrasound-responsive bacterium. We constructed the prokar-
yotic expression plasmid harboring temperature-actuated ther-
apeutic circuit which carries murine IFN-γ gene with N-terminal
OmpA secretion signal peptide or mCherry ﬂuorescent reporter
gene under the pR-pL tandem promoter (Fig. 2a). Then the
recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli MG1655
(a non-pathogenic bacterium) to prepare ultrasound-responsive
bacterium (URB). Incubation of the engineered bacteria harbor-
ing mCherry gene at 37 °C did not produce any ﬂuorescence
signals, showing the suppressed expression of mCherry ﬂuor-
escent gene at 37 °C. In contrast, strong red ﬂuorescent signals
could be observed at 6 h after the bacterium incubation tem-
perature rose to 45 °C, revealing that TcI repression was relieved
to initiate the mCherry gene expression (Fig. 2b). Prolonging the
bacterial incubation time at 45 °C from 5 min to 25 min increased
the ﬂuorescent signal intensities, which conﬁrmed the controll-
ability of thermal logic circuits of URB (Fig. 2c). To develop a
noninvasive remote control of bacterial gene circuits by focused
ultrasound, we optimized a series of acoustic parameters
including acoustic energies, irradiation duration time at ON/OFF
state. Results showed that the parameters at 4.93 MPa acoustic
pressure, 3 s ON and 5 s OFF periodic irradiation could keep the
bacterium solution at 45 °C constant temperature (Fig. 2d).
Plating these irradiated URB on the solid LB plates revealed that
the activity of bacteria was not affected by water-bath heating or
ultrasound irradiation at 45 °C for 30 min (Supplementary Fig. 1).
After the ultrasound irradiation, URB could successfully express
mCherry ﬂuorescent protein and the ﬂuorescence signal intensity
increased gradually along with time, achieving to the peak on
day 3, and then gradually fell down until day 7 (Fig. 2e, Sup-
plementary Fig. 2). To elucidate the remote controllability of
bacterial gene expression, we inserted a tube ﬁlled with bacteria
into an agar phantom with or without acoustic exposure for

30 min at the optimal ultrasound parameters. Figure 2f showed
the ﬂuorescence signals only appeared in the sample received with
ultrasound irradiation, but not in these bacteria that did not
receive with ultrasound exposure. In addition to controlling the
temperature of the bacterial solution in vitro, the temperature of
the local tissue of mice could also be increased to 45 °C by
adjusting the appropriate ultrasonic parameters (Supplementary
Fig. 3). In vivo animal experiment further revealed that the livers
of mice administrated intravenously with URB could emit the
strong ﬂuorescence signals after ultrasound irradiation at the
above optimized acoustic parameters. By contrast, the livers from
the non-irradiated control mice or the incubator-heating mice at
45 °C did just emit weak background ﬂuorescence signals
(Fig. 2g, h). These results showed that ultrasound can function as
a remote tool to regulate the gene expression of bacteria when
they harbored some temperature-based gene control elements
in vitro and in vivo.
In vitro treatment experiment of ultrasound-responsive bac-
terium-mediated tumor immunotherapy. Next, we engineered
one therapeutic URB by displacing the ﬂuorescent mCherry gene
with murine IFN-γ gene with N-terminal OmpA signal sequence
in the thermal logic circuits. Agarose gel electrophoresis con-
ﬁrmed the presence of IFN-γ gene fragment in the plasmid
(Supplementary Fig. 4). SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis analysis
revealed that IFN-γ proteins appeared only in the lysate of bac-
teria incubated at 45 °C for 30 min, but not in the lysate of bac-
teria incubated at 37 °C, conﬁrming the production of therapeutic
IFN-γ after thermal treatment (Fig. 3a). The western blot assay
further conﬁrmed the IFN-γ expression in both bacteria lysate
and culture medium after heat treatment (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Prolonging the ultrasound irradiation time at 45 °C from 20 min
to 80 min increased the expression level of IFN-γ proteins,
showing a time-dependent correlation (Fig. 3b). These results
showed the designed therapeutic logic circuit can be strictly
controlled and tuned by heating or ultrasound stimulation and
their exposure duration, which is important for many therapeutic
factors to execute their anti-tumor effects. Cell killing assay by
CCK-8 kits revealed that the cell viability was 33.13 ± 2.40%,
38.93 ± 5.69%, 47.02 ± 16.51%, 63.09 ± 6.02% or 68.50 ± 4.16% or
95.90 ± 1.49% for 150 pg/ml, 125 pg/ml, 100 pg/ml, 75 pg/ml,
50 pg/ml or 0 pg/ml IFN-γ proteins in the bacterial supernatant,
respectively. It was signiﬁcantly lower than these cells incubated
with the equivalent supernatant from non-induced bacteria
(Fig. 3c). To test whether the IFN-γ proteins could be secreted
from their host bacteria to kill tumor cells, the Calcein AM/PI
staining assay was used to 4T1 breast cancer cells which were
incubated with bacterial supernatant containing different con-
centrations of IFN-γ proteins from 50–150 pg/ml. Almost all the
cells showed green ﬂuorescence in the blank group, showing no
Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of URB in controlling IFN-γ expression by focused ultrasound and their mechanisms for cancer immunotherapy. Upon
systemic administration of URB that contains IFN-γ gene inserted in the temperature-sensitive genetic circuit, these genetically engineered bacteria would
deliver into the tumors due to their tumor-targeting capability. Then, the tumor was irradiated by focused ultrasound to heat these intratumoral bacteria to
42–45°C for inducing the expression of IFN-γ gene. The production and secretion of IFN-γ not only can promote the apoptosis of cancer cells, but also
induce the macrophage polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype and the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Right panel).In addition, high levels of IFN-γ
can also activate macrophages and T cells in the spleen to inhibit lung metastasis and distant tumor growth through immune memory responses
(Left panel).

dead cells. With the increase of IFN-γ proteins, the proportion of
living cells (green ﬂuorescence) decreased gradually, while the
proportion of dead cells (red ﬂuorescence) increased gradually
(Fig. 3d).
IFN-γ can exert its cytotoxicity and immunoregulatory effects
by activating Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and signal transducers and
activators of transcription1 (STAT1) signaling pathways30–32.
The effect of IFN-γ expressed from URB on macrophage immune
activation was further examined in vitro. The RAW 264.7
macrophages were incubated with IFN-γ expressed by bacteria
for 48 h, revealing a similar effect as the traditional IFN-γ in
promoting the generation of proinﬂammatory M1 phenotype
macrophages, with about 29.0% of macrophages staining positive

bacterial
IFN-γ (Fig. 3e, f). Also, the signiﬁcantly decreased expression of
M2 phenotype marker CD206 could be observed on the
macrophages (Fig. 3g), conﬁrming that IFN-γ released from the
URB can induce the macrophage polarization from M2 to M1
phenotype. Meanwhile, the bacterial IFN-γ also triggered to
produce higher level of nitric oxide (NO) in the macrophages in
comparison with the control group (Fig. 3h). Furthermore, we
detected the tumor cell killing efﬁcacy of these activated
macrophages stimulated by different concentrations of bacterial
IFN-γ, ﬁnding that higher concentrations of IFN-γ were used to
stimulate macrophages, stronger cytotoxicity these activated
macrophages would be (Fig. 3i). Together, the above results

Tumor targeting of ultrasound-responsive bacterium. In order
to detect the tumor-targeting property of these engineered
bacteria, the DiR-labelled live URB or dead URB treated with
65 °C for 30 min were injected intravenously into the 4T1

ﬂuorescence at the tumor site was observed along with time
from the mice received live DiR-labelled URB administration,
but not from the control mice injected with the dead URB. 48 h
after administration, mice were euthanized to analyze the
ﬂuorescence signals in various organs (Fig. 4b). The results
showed that the distribution of dead URB are mainly in liver
and spleen. By contrast, the accumulation of the live URB was
higher in the tumor site, and less in the liver than the control
group. The quantitative analysis revealed a ﬁve-fold increase of
relative ﬂuorescence intensity in the tumor of live URB group
compared with dead URB, which is consistent with the results
of in vivo ﬂuorescence imaging (Fig. 4c).
Subsequently, the targeting efﬁciency of DiR-labelled URB to
the tumor was determined by ﬂuorescence microscope. As
showed in Fig. 4d, the red ﬂuorescence signal, which represents
the distribution of DiR-labelled live URB, mainly appeared in the
tumor tissues but not in the heart, kidney and lung, and a bit in
the liver and spleen. By contrast, only a little of red ﬂuorescence
could be observed in the tumor for DiR-labelled dead URB.
Interestingly, the red ﬂuorescence of DiR-labelled live URB were
largely distributed in the center of tumor which represents the
hypoxic and necrotic region due to the insufﬁcient nutrient
supply. Different from the live URB, the dead URB mainly
appeared in the peritumoral zone. Immunoﬂuorescence staining
assay conﬁrmed that URB localized in the region where the HIF-
1α highly expressed, but not in the region where the tumor was
not hypoxic (Fig. 4e). These results illustrated that the live URB
rather than the dead URB could be efﬁciently accumulated in the
tumor site and penetrated the tumor hypoxic and necrotic region.
It may be the chemoreceptors on the surface of E. coli sense the
nutrient-rich and low-oxygen tumor microenvironment, promot-
ing them to migrate actively in the tumor region33,34. In order to
further explore the behaviors of these engineered URB after
intravenous injection, 4T1-bearing mice received URB at the dose
of 1 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) per mouse via intravenous
injection and then sacriﬁced at 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 days after
injection. Various organs and tumor were collected, homo-
genized, serially diluted (10–10000 fold), and incubated on
Luria–Bertani (LB) plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The
colony counts in each plate revealed that URB were gradually
eliminated from heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. However,
the colony counts of tumors showed exponential growth along
with the time, achieving the peak value after seven days and then
decreasing gradually (Fig. 4f, g). There was not bacterial colony
formation from any tissue homogenates when the dead URB were
used for intravenous injection into these mice. Collectively, these
results provided evidence for their capability of the engineered
bacteria to home, penetrate and colonize in the tumors,
attributing to the hypoxic, immunosuppressive, and biochemi-
cally unique tumor microenvironment35–37.
In vivo experiment of ultrasound-responsive bacterium-medi-
ated tumor immunotherapy. To evaluate the anti-tumor effect of
URB combined with focused ultrasound in vivo, unilateral 4T1
tumor-bearing mice model were treated following the therapeutic
schedule in Fig. 5a. The mice were randomly separated into six
groups and treated with saline (control), ultrasound alone (US),
E. coli MG1655 harboring without the circuit (E. coli), URB
harboring the circuit (URB), E. coli + ultrasound (E. coli + US) or
URB + US group, respectively. 48 h after intravenous injection,
ultrasound irradiation was performed to trigger the expression of
IFN-γ. The treatment procedure was repeated once after seven
days. As shown in Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Figs. 6, 7, the
volume of tumors in each group was similar on the day 1.
However, URB + US group exhibited the strongest tumor inhi-
bitory effect against tumor growth and the longest survival time.
The average tumor volume of the mice treated with URB + US
was less than 250 mm3, whereas that of other treated groups are
more than 1000 mm3. Slight anti-tumor effect of US, E. coli or
URB, or E. coli groups could be observed in our study, which may
attribute to 30-min hyperthermia at 45 °C produced by US, the
presence of lipopolysaccharide in the bacteria or nutrient com-
petition due to bacterial growth38–40. The median survival time of
mice in URB + US group increased to 60 days compared with
42 days for control group, which proved that application of URB
combined with ultrasound irradiation could improve survival rate
signiﬁcantly. Compared with other groups, the treatment of
URB + US resulted in apparent damages on the tumor cells
(Fig. 5d, up row). The maximum degree of cell apoptosis was also
found by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Fig. 5d, middle row). More-
over, URB + US showed much less expression of Ki67 in
immunoﬂuorescence staining (Fig. 5d, low row), demonstrating
signiﬁcant reduced tumor proliferation potentials. The results of
body weight demonstrated that systemic administration of URB
did not cause severe side effects to mice (Supplementary Fig. 8).
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10a, we can see that the tumor
cells expressing MHC class I signiﬁcantly increased in the
URB + US group, achieving 39.35 ± 2.53% MHC I+ cell ratio in
comparison with URB (29.5 ± 3.02%), US (28.75 ± 4.03%) and
control (21.83 ± 9.13%) groups. Since IFN-γ can induce polariza-
tion of M1 macrophages41, we further explored whether the
treatment activated the intratumoral immune response. Flow
cytometry analysis of the polarization of tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) demonstrated CD80+ macrophages greatly
improved and CD206+ macrophages signiﬁcantly decreased in
the tumors treated with URB + US in comparison with control,
only US and only URB groups, indicating that URB + US
treatment could effectively promoted the polarization of TAMs
from M2 phenotype towards M1 phenotype (Fig. 5e–h, Supple-
mentary Figs. 9, 10b). In addition, we found URB + US treatment

markedly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5i). The
proliferation, exhaustion and activation of T cells were further
analyzed and revealed that Ki67+CD4+ and Ki67+CD8+ T cell
signiﬁcantly increased in the URB + US group in comparison
with URB, US and control groups (Fig. 5j, Supplementary

T cells which indicate of T cell exhaustion could be observed in
the URB + US group than URB, US and control groups (Fig. 5k,

of tumors treated with URB + US was much less than those of
the control, US and URB groups (Fig. 5l, Supplementary Fig. 10g).

with the control groups, treatment with URB + US not only
increased the number of functional CD4+ T cells in tumor,
including IFN-γ+CD4+ (Supplementary Fig. 11a) and TNF-α
+CD4+ (Fig. 5m, n) T cells, but also elevated the number of
functional CD8+ T cells, such as IFN-γ+CD8+ (Supplementary
Fig. 11b), TNF-α+CD8+ (Fig. 5o, p) and GranzymeB+CD8+
(Supplementary Fig. 11c) T cells. Moreover, signiﬁcantly higher
IFN-γ (Fig. 5q), TNF-α (Fig. 5r) and IL-1β (Fig. 5s) levels but less
IL-10 (Fig. 5t) levels could be detected in the URB + US-treated
tumors after 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. Thus, our data suggested that URB
combined with ultrasound could effectively activate anti-tumor
immunity through inducing the expression of IFN-γ. Some
previous studies have used IFN-γ for tumor treatment and found
that the inﬁltration of lymphocytes such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+
T cells, and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment
increased signiﬁcantly42. The signiﬁcantly reduced ability of
TAM to produce arginase-1 and iNOS was also demonstrated
after IFN-γ treatment43. All these data suggested that IFN-γ could
promote M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment,
thereby improving the efﬁcacy of tumor immunotherapy.
In vivo experiment of ultrasound-responsive bacterium-medi-
ated distant tumor and metastasis treatment. Since the anti-
tumor immunity of URB could be effectively activate by ultra-
sound in vitro, we next wondered whether the immune response
triggered by URB combined with ultrasound can inhibit the
growth of distant tumors. Bilateral 4T1 tumor-bearing mice
model were established to explore the treatment-elicited abscopal
(left) therapeutic effect by treating the primary (right) tumor.
Firstly, we have detected the gene expression in the bilateral
tumor-bearing mice model. As Supplementary Fig. 12a showed,
the expression of ﬂuorescent protein could be observed in the US-
irradiated tumor (right) but not in the non-irradiated tumor
(left). The ﬂuorescent signals from US-irradiated tumor increased
gradually along with the time (up to seven days). The ex vitro
imaging of heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney and tumor after 12
and 48 h further conﬁrmed that US irradiation could induce the
in-situ expression of mCherry gene (Supplementary Fig. 12b, c).
As depicted in Fig. 6a, 4T1 cancer cells were inoculated at
day −10 (right) and day −7 (left), respectively. A week later when
the right ﬂank tumors were about 100 mm3 (day 0), the engi-
neered URB at 107 CFU were systematacially administrated by
tail vein and followed by ultrasound irradiation at two days later
(day 2). As expected, signiﬁcant anti-tumor effects were observed
in the primary tumors received with ultrasound irradiation and
URB administration (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Figs. 13, 14).
Interestingly, the distant tumors from URB + US group were also
greatly inhibited in comparison with control, US, E. coli, URB,
E. coli + US groups (Fig. 6c, Supplementary Figs. 13, 14). The
survival rate of the mice treated with URB + US was greatly
improved, with more than 80% of them still alive on 60th day post
the tumor inoculation (Fig. 6d). Notably, only very few metastatic
foci were observed in the lungs of mice treated with URB + US
(Fig. 6e–g), suggesting effective inhibition of lung metastasis. In
addition, we also demonstrated that systemic administration of
URB did not cause severe side effects to mice by body weight
monitoring (Supplementary Fig. 15). All of these data indicated
URB + US resulted in a robust anti-tumor immune effect to
protect mice from distant tumors and metastasis.
To understand the mechanism of the anti-tumor systemic
effects triggered by URB plus ultrasound, immune cells in the
spleen were assessed on the 7th day after the ﬁrst treatment by
bilaterally 4T1 cancer model. The percentage of M1 phenotype
macrophages
(CD80+)
and
M2
phenotype
macrophages
(CD206+) in spleens was evaluated. The results showed that
the proportion of CD80+ macrophages in the URB + US group
was 21.6 ± 1.53 %, with a signiﬁcantly increase compared with
saline control group (9.22 ± 3.78%) (Fig. 6h, i, Supplementary
Figs. 16, 17a). In contrast, the proportion of CD206+ macro-
phages in spleen were signiﬁcantly decreased to 15.58 ± 2.83%
(Fig. 6j, k). Speciﬁcally, the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
in
the
URB + US
group
occupied
13.75 ± 3.13%
and
33.23 ± 4.44% with an increase by nearly 3.6 and 2.7 times in
comparison with the control group, respectively (Fig. 6l). Further
analysis found a signiﬁcant increase of proliferative CD4+
(Ki67+CD4+) and CD8+ T cells (Ki67+CD8+), but a signiﬁcant
decrease of Treg (FOXP3+CD4+) in the spleen of mice treated
with URB + US (Fig. 6m, n, Supplementary Fig. 17b–d). To
further analyze the immunological memory effect, we detected
the central memory T cell population in spleen and found that
treatment with URB + US signiﬁcantly increased the number of
central memory CD8+ T cells (CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L+) and
central
memory
CD4+T
cells
(CD3+CD4+CD44+CD62L+)
(Fig. 6o, Supplementary Fig. 18). The functional CD8+ T cells
including GranzymeB+CD8+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 17e),
IFN-γ+CD8+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 17f) and TNF-α+CD8+
cells (Fig. 6p, q) had the largest ratios in the spleens of mice
treated with URB + US in comparison with other groups. These
activated T cells led to a marked increase in IFN-γ (Fig. 6r) and
TNF-α (Fig. 6s) level in blood.
Next, the proliferative and functional T cell population in the
distant tumors were also detected to clarify the mechanism of
growth inhibition of distant tumors. Data from ﬂow cytometry
analysis of these T cells by Ki67, TNF-α, IFN-γ and Gramzyme B
markers conﬁrmed signiﬁcantly increased proliferative and
functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in URB + US group
(Supplementary Figs. 19a, b, 20a–e). Notably, Tim-3+CD4+
and Tim-3+CD8+ T cell population signiﬁcantly decreased,
showing there were less exhausted T cells (Supplementary

Moreover,
CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L-
and
CD3+CD4+CD44+CD62L- cell populations in distant tumors
signiﬁcantly increased in the URB + US-treated distant tumors,
indicating that there were more effector CD4+ and CD8+
memory T cells (Fig. 6t, Supplementary Fig. 21). To investigate
the change of immunosuppressive microenvironment, ELISA was
used to detect the levels of TGF-β in the distant tumors. Results
showed that treatment with URB + US signiﬁcantly decreased the
TGF-β levels in distant tumors in comparison with other groups
(Fig. 6u). Collectively, these results indicated that the URB + US
treatment could trigger the systemic anti-tumor immunity to
inhibit the distant tumor growth and metastasis44–46.

To explore the anti-tumor efﬁcacy of URB + US in the deep-
seated tumor, we established a mouse orthotopically transplanted
liver tumor model by intrahepatic injection of H22-Luc cells. As
shown in Fig. 7a, four days after H22-Luc cells were inoculated in
the liver of mice, the E. coli or engineered URB were
administrated intravenously into the mice. Still two days later,
ultrasound irradiation was applied to irradiate the tumors. From
the data shown in Fig. 7b, we can see that similar ﬂuorescent
signals could be observed in each group on the day 5, showing the
successful development of orthotopically transplanted H22-Luc
liver tumors. No signiﬁcant tumor inhibitory effects were found
in the control, only US and E.coli groups. Slight tumor inhibitory
effects were observed in the URB and E.coli + US groups.
However, URB + US group exhibited strongest tumor inhibitory
effect (Fig. 7b, c). The median survival time of mice in URB + US
group increased to 63 days compared with 33 days for control
group (Fig. 7d). These data indicated URB + US could signiﬁ-
cantly inhibit the orthotopic liver tumor growth and improve the
survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. Meanwhile, no signiﬁcant
change of the weight of the mice was found in the URB + US-
treated mice (Fig. 7e).
In order to further explore the biosafety of this therapeutic
strategy, the changes of mouse body weight and histopathologic
features of major organs were evaluated. No signiﬁcant body
weight changes of mice were found in the different treatment
(Supplementary Fig. 5), demonstrating the good biosafety of the
URB-mediated immunotherapy. In our study, cell damage was
not observed in the H&E staining slices of various organs of
different group mice (Supplementary Fig. 22). In spite of this, it is
necessary to optimize the ultrasonic parameters to keep the
constant temperature at 45 °C for in vivo application since too
high temperature (>50 °C) would strongly associated with tissue
damage over 30 s. The blood biochemistry and blood cell counts
were recorded, showing that all of indexes of the URB + US
group fell within the normal ranges. Only creatinine and direct
bilirubin increased and platelet (PLT) decrease in the URB + US
group when comparing with saline control (Supplementary
Tables 1, 2). Because URB had less accumulation in normal
tissues such as organs and blood. Previous studies used a similar
bacteria strain to our study, E. coli MG1655, and conﬁrmed that
the strain was safe and did not affect the homeostasis of the
body21.
Discussion
In this study, we have engineered an ultrasound-responsive
bacterium (URB) for remote control of the expression of cytokine
IFN-γ gene by focused ultrasound-induced hyperthermia. The
genetically engineered bacterium (E. coli MG1655) could selec-
tively accumulate and grow at the hypoxic region of tumors upon
systemic administration, making it possible to locally produce
cytokine IFN-γ under acoustic irradiation. As demonstrated in
Figs. 5b, c and 7b–d, URB exhibited signiﬁcant tumor-suppressive
effects upon their exposure to ultrasound in both the sub-
cutaneously transplanted breast tumor model and the orthoto-
pically transplanted liver tumor model, greatly prolonging the
survival time of the tumor-bearing mice. It is worth mentioning
that treatment with URB + US also exhibited the strong tumor
inhibitory effect against distant tumor growth in the bilateral 4T1
tumor-bearing mice model and reduced the number of lung
metastatic colonies (Fig. 6c, e–g). It may mainly contribute to the
anti-tumor immune response activated by IFN-γ. As showed in
Fig. 5e–i, markedly increased CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and
CD80+ macrophages while signiﬁcantly decreased CD206+
macrophages could be observed in the tumors treated with
URB + US, indicating that URB + US treatment could effectively
repolarize TAMs towards M1 phenotype and thus improving the
macrophages phagocytosis and T cell activation.
It needs to be pointed out that the in vivo toxicity is still a
concern for the clinical translation of bacteria-mediated immu-
notherapy. Our biosafety study showed URB + US treatment did
not produce signiﬁcant tissue damage and body weight changes
to these mice (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 22).
The good biosafety of URB + US treatment not only may con-
tribute to the targeted expression of cytokines which reduces the
risk of cytokine storms, but also to the rapid removal of bacteria
by normal organs. Scalability is also a critical issue that needs to
be addressed for clinical application. Previous study reported a
thermosensitive therapeutic bacterium and triggered the in-situ
TNF-α expression of bacteria by near-infrared light21. However, it
is difﬁcult to act on deep-seated tumors in live animals due to the
poor tissue penetration of near-infrared light. By contrast,
ultrasound has higher tissue permeability and can irradiate dee-
per tumors seated in liver, pancreas, prostate or ovary. Our results
also conﬁrmed that URB + US treatment could be applied to the
orthotopically transplanted liver tumor (Fig. 7). Although sig-
niﬁcantly enhanced anti-tumor efﬁcacy and good safety of
URB + US treatment have been seen in this study, some steps are
still necessary to be identiﬁed for the future clinic use. For
example, the safer non-pathogenic bacteria or attenuated bacteria
in which virulence genes were deleted should be used. As an
alternative, it is possible to achieve the acoustic control of ther-
apeutic gene expression for anti-tumor therapy by using of T cells
or NK cells. In fact, literatures have reported that T cells could be
engineered with thermal sensitive gene circuits to realize intra-
tumoral
cytokine
or
protein
expression
for
anti-tumor
therapy47–49. In addition, the expression level of therapeutic
genes needs to be further optimized for achieving optimal ther-
apeutic outcomes in the future clinical application.
In summary, we have developed an ultrasound-responsive
bacterium (URB) which can express therapeutic genes in an
acoustic control of gene expression manner. Our study reveals the
URB carrying cytokine IFN-γ gene had good tumor-targeting

pBV220 plasmid was purchased from Miaoling Bioscience & Technology Co.(W-
uhan, China). E. coli DH5α strain and E. coli MG1655 strain were purchased from
Angyubio Biotechnology Co. (Shanghai, China). The mouse breast cancer cells
(4T1) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) culture medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and
streptomycin solution, trypsin containing 0.25% EDTA were purchased from
Gibco (USA). 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR),
live & dead cell viability detection kit and CCK-8 assay kit were obtained from
Beyotime Biotechnology Co. (Shanghai, China). Murine IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10,
IL-1β and TGF-β enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were obtained
from Dakewe Bioengineering Co. (Shenzhen, China).
Preparation of ultrasound-responsive bacterium. The IFN-γ gene with
N-terminal OmpA secretion signal sequence was inserted into a pBV220 plasmid
through EcoRI and SalI enzyme digestion and ligation reactions to generate the
IFN-γ-expressed thermosensitive plasmid (pBV220-IFN-γ). The recombinant
plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH5α competent cells by chemical trans-
formation protocol. The construction of pBV220-IFN-γ plasmid was conﬁrmed by
enzyme digestion. Also, the mCherry-expressed thermosensitive control plasmid
(pBV220-mCherry) was constructed to facilitate the detection of gene expression.
The pBV220-IFN-γ or pBV220-mCherry plasmids were transformed chemically to
the E. coli MG1655 strain to obtain ultrasound-responsive bacterium (URB). The
resulting URB solution was plated on LB solid plate with ampicillin and incubated
at 37 °C for 12 h. URB colonies were picked out and ampliﬁed in LB medium at
30 °C, 220 rpm overnight. Afterward, the URB solution was diluted by 100-folds
into LB medium and further grown to the OD600 = 0.4–0.6 for further experiments.
Thermal-induced and ultrasound-induced mCherry expression. The URB
transformed with pBV220-mCherry plasmid were incubated at 37 °C or 45 °C for a
given time and further incubation for 6 h at 37 °C. The IVIS Spectrum was used to
detect the ﬂuorescence signal of bacteria. To test the feasibility of ultrasound-
induced mCherry gene expression, the URB was added to a 96-well plate (200 μl
each well). Ultrasound with acoustic pressure of 2.82 MPa, 3.17 MPa, 3.52 MPa,
3.88 MPa, 4.22 MPa and 4.93 MPa were used to generate heating to induce gene
expression. The ON/OFF ultrasound irradiation procedure was adjusted to keep
the temperature constant. Other ultrasound parameters were as follows: fre-
quency = 960 Hz, pulse period = 150 ms, pulse width = 100 ms, irradiation
time = 30 min. The temperature of URB solution was monitored by an infrared
thermal imager. In the following in vitro experiments, we will use this parameter
(4.93 MPa acoustic negative pressure, 3 s ON and 5 s OFF irradiation time) which
could keep the irradiated bacterium solution at 45 °C constant temperature. After
ultrasound irradiation, the ﬂuorescence signal of URB solution was observed at
different time points (from 1 day to 7 day) after irradiation. To examine the
penetration of the ultrasonic stimulation, 1% agar phantom was made and inserted
a tube ﬁlled with URB, keeping the tube 10 cm away from the transducer. Then the
tube was irradiated by ultrasound for 30 min. The ﬂuorescence signal of URB was
detected by IVIS Spectrum. To detect the activity of bacteria after ultrasound
irradiation, URB treated with ultrasound or heating (45 °C) was plated on the LB
plate to record colonies or added to 96 well to observed OD600 change during 48 h
culture.
Due to the difference in thermal properties and ultrasonic energy absorption of
experimental samples (bacterial solution and mouse tissue), it is still necessary to
explore the speciﬁc ultrasonic parameters to raise the temperature of animal
tissues. Balb/c mice (female, 6–8 weeks) were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and
focus ultrasound was used to irradiate mice right thigh. Ultrasound with acoustic
negative pressure of 2.82, 3.17, 3.52, 3.88, 4.22 and 4.93 MPa were used for
irradiation, respectively. The ON/OFF ultrasound irradiation procedure was
adjusted to keep the temperature constant. The temperature of mice thigh was
monitored by an infrared thermal imager. In the following in vivo experiments, we
will use this parameter (3.52 MPa acoustic negative pressure, 3 s ON and 5 s OFF
irradiation time) which could keep the irradiated mice tissue at 45 °C constant
temperature. In order to conﬁrm the in vivo gene expression of URB, 1 × 107 CFU
of URB were injected into the Balb/c mice via the tail vein and ultrasound was used
to irradiate the liver of mice at 3.52 MPa acoustic pressure for 30 min. Fluorescence
signal of mice and the major organs were detected by IVIS at 6 h after ultrasound
irradiation. As a control, the mice in the heat group were placed in an incubator at
45 °C for 30 min.
Thermal-induced and ultrasound-induced IFN-γ expression. The URB trans-
formed with pBV220-IFN-γ plasmid was cultured to OD600 0.4–0.6 in 30 °C moved
to 37 °C or 45 °C for 30 min. After that, the bacteria proteins were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE to detect the IFN-γ expression in URB. Meanwhile, western blot was
used to conﬁrm the IFN-γ expression in bacteria lysate and culture medium. To
determine the expression level of IFN-γ induced by ultrasound, URB was added to
a 96-well plate and exposed to ultrasound (acoustic pressure = 4.93 MPa) for
20 min to 80 min. and the murine IFN-γ ELISA kit was used to quantitatively
analyze the concentration of IFN-γ in bacterial culture medium.
Cell cytotoxicity of IFN-γ expressed by ultrasound-responsive bacterium.
Breast cancer 4T1 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells per well), and
then incubated in 100 μl DMEM medium containing 10% FBS for 12 h. URB were
used to induce and secrete the IFN-γ protein by ultrasound irradiation. The
concentration of IFN-γ in ultrasound-induced URB culture supernatant was
determined by ELASA kits and diluted to the indicated concentrations (from 0 to
150 pg/ml) with DMEM medium. The bacterial culture supernatant with corre-
sponding concentrations of IFN-γ (0–150 pg/ml) was added into the tumor cells.
The same volume of bacterial culture supernatant of URB which was not induced
by ultrasound was used as the control. After incubating for 6 h, the tumor cells
were washed with PBS for three times. CCK-8 kits were used to detect the cell
cytotoxicity of IFN-γ expressed by URB according to the production illustration.
Similarly, Calcein AM/PI staining was used to detect the 4T1 breast cancer cell
viability after IFN-γ treatment. The ﬂuorescence microscope was used to observe
the ﬂuorescent signal of tumor cells.
Immunological activity of IFN-γ expressed by ultrasound-responsive bacter-
ium. The immunological activity of IFN-γ expressed by URB was evaluated by
macrophages activation. RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded into a 96-well plate
(8 × 103 cells per well), and then incubated in 100 μl DMEM medium containing
10% FBS for 12 h. The bacterial culture supernatant with corresponding con-
centrations of IFN-γ (50–150 pg/ml) was added into the macrophages and incu-
bated for 48 h. To detect the phenotype of macrophages, the treated RAW 264.7
macrophages were stained with corresponding antibodies: CD86-PE (Biolegend,
Cat No. 105007, dilution ratio 1:100), CD80-BV421 (Biolegend, Cat No. 104725,
dilution ratio 1:100) and CD206-APC (Biolegend, Cat No. 141707, dilution ratio
1:100) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed by ﬂow cyto-
metry. PE-Rat IgG2a (Biolegend, Cat No. 400507, dilution ratio 1:100), BV421-IgG
(Biolegend, Cat No. 400935, dilution ratio 1:100) and APC-Rat IgG2a (Biolegend,
Cat No. 400511, dilution ratio 1:100) were used for isotype control. After that, The
NO detection kit (Beyotime, Cat No. S0021S) was used to detect the NO level in
macrophage culture medium. Moreover, RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with
different levels of IFN-γ were collected and used to co-incubate with tumor cells at
a MOI ratio of 5:1 in 96-well plate for 12 h, and the tumor killing activity was
evaluated with CCK-8 kit.
Breast cancer model establishment. Balb/c mice were purchased from Vital
River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Animal experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of
the Animal Experiment Center of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences(SIAT-IACUC-210831-HCS-YF-A2043). The tumor-
bearing animals requires to be euthanized when the tumor burden reaches
2000 cm3 in volume. In some cases, this limit has been exceeded the last day of
measurement and the mice were immediately euthanized. The tumor volume =
tumor length × tumor width2 × 0.5. Mice were housed in a Speciﬁc-pathogen-free
(SPF) facility at 23–25 °C on a 12-h light/dark cycle with enough food and water.
The female Balb/c mice (4–6 weeks) were used to establish xenograft tumor model.
1 × 106 4T1 breast cancer cells in 100 μl DMEM medium were injected sub-
cutaneously into the right thigh of the mice. The tumor volume was measured
every two days after tumor implantation, and the treatment procedure was per-
formed afterthe mice tumor volume reached to 100 mm3. The mice were anes-
thetized with 1–2% isoﬂurane in oxygen via a nose cone in experiments. All mice
were euthanized by using carbon dioxide asphyxiation after experiments.
Tumor targeting of ultrasound-responsive bacterium. The concentration of
URB was adjusted to 1 × 108 CFU/ml. DiR dye was added to the URB solution
(30 μl/mL) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The bacteria solution was washed
with PBS until the supernatant was clear. The bacteria were injected into the
tumor-bearing mice via the tail vein (1 × 107 CFU per mouse) (n = 4). As the
control, the dead URB were treated at 65 °C for 30 min. At the given time points,
the mice were imaged by IVIS system (PekinEmer) to evaluate the biodistribution
and tumor accumulation of bacteria. 48 h after the intravenous injection, tumor-
bearing mice were sacriﬁced and the organs including heart, lung, liver, kidney,
spleen and tumor were collected for the ex vivo ﬂuorescence imaging. Meanwhile,
the organs and tumor were cut into slices with 5 μm thickness, followed by staining
with DAPI and FITC-labeled anti-HIF-1α antibody. To evaluate the number of
URB in each organ (CFU per gram of tissue), different time after administration
with URB at 1 day, 2 day, 7 day, 14 day and 21 day, organs of mice including heart,
liver, spleen, lung, kidney and tumor were collected, weighed and homogenized in
sterile PBS in ice. The tissue grinding solution was diluted from 10 to 10000 times
with PBS. 100 μl tissue grinding solution was plated on the LB plate with 100 μg/ml
ampicillin. The colonies formed after incubation for 12 h at 37 °C was counted.
In vivo tumor treatment. The 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with approximate tumor
volume of 100 mm3 were divided into six groups randomly (n = 9), including
control group, US group, E. coli group, URB group, E. coli + US group and
URB + US group. 1 × 107 URB in 200 μl saline was injected intravenously into
tumor-bearing mice in URB group and URB + US group. 1 × 107 E. coli MG1655
was injected intravenously into tumor-bearing mice in E. coli group and

E. coli + US group. The control group was injected with the 200 μl of saline. After
48 h of bacteria injection, the mice in US group, E. coli + US group and URB + US
group were irradiated with the ultrasound for 30 min. The ultrasound parameter
was as follows: acoustic pressure = 3.52 MPa, frequency = 960 Hz, pulse period =
150 ms, pulse width = 100 ms, ON 10 s/OFF 5 s. The treatment procedure was
performed day 0 and day 7. Then tumor volumes and mice weights were recorded
every 2 days. The calculation formula of tumor volume was: volume = (tumor
length × tumor width2)/2. When the mice died, the survival time was recorded.
After the mice died, the tumor were collected for H&E staining, TUNEL assay and
Ki67 staining.
For ﬂow cytometry analysis of intratumoral immune cells, the tumors were
collected at seven days after treatment and cut into small pieces, then the tissue was
digested with collagenase V (2 mg/ml, YEASEN) in HBSS solution for 4 h at 37 °C.
Cells were then ﬁltered through 70 μm cell strainer to obtain single-cell suspension
and washed with FACS buffer. The single cell suspension was pre-blocked with
CD16/32 antibodies (Biolegend, Cat No. 101319) for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the cells
were stained with the following surface antibodies: CD45 (Biolegend, Cat No.
103127, dilution ratio 1:100), CD3 (Biolegend, Cat No. 100203, dilution ratio
1:100), CD4 (Biolegend, Cat No. 116019, dilution ratio 1:100), CD8 (Biolegend, Cat
No. 100721, dilution ratio 1:100), Tim-3 (Biolegend, Cat No. 119703, dilution ratio
1:50), CD11b (Biolegend, Cat No. 101205, dilution ratio 1:100), F4/80 (Biolegend,
Cat No. 123151, dilution ratio 1:100), CD80 (Biolegend, Cat No. 104725,
dilution ratio 1:100), MHC II (Biolegend, Cat No. 107641, dilution ratio 1:100),
CD206 (Biolegend, Cat No. 141707, dilution ratio 1:100), MHC I (Biolegend,
Cat No. 114613, dilution ratio 1:100), CD44 (Biolegend, Cat No. 141707),
CD62L424401103023, dilution ratio 1:50), CD62L (Biolegend, Cat No. 104435,
dilution ratio 1:50) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the
intracellular and intranuclear staining, after surface staining, the cell suspension
was ﬁxed and permeabilized with True-Nuclear™Transcription Factor Buffer Set
(Biolegend, Cat No. 424401) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. The
cells were stained with the following intracellular or intranuclear antibodies: IFN-γ
(Biolegend, Cat No. 505831, dilution ratio 1:50), TNF-α (Biolegend, Cat No.
506307, dilution ratio 1:50), Granzyme B (Biolegend, Cat No. 372207, dilution ratio
1:50), Ki67 (Biolegend, Cat No. 652403, dilution ratio 1:100), FOXP3 (Biolegend,
Cat No. 126419, dilution ratio 1:50) and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. The data were
analyzed using FlowJo. The intratumor levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10
were detected with ELISA kits (Dakewe) according to the instructions on the day 1,
day 3, day 5 and day 7 after the treatment.
Distant tumor and metastasis treatment. For the 4T1 distant tumor model
establishment, 1 × 106 4T1 breast cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the
right thigh of Balb/c mice. On the third day after the inoculation, another 1 × 106
4T1 cells were injected into the left thigh of mice. After 10 day of the ﬁrst
inoculation, the mice were divided into six groups and treated as described above
(n = 9). After 48 h of bacteria injection, the primary tumor of mice in US group,
E.coli + US group and URB + US group were irradiated with the ultrasound for
30 min. The treatment procedure was performed day 0 and day 7. Tumor volume,
body weight and survival time of mice were recorded continuously. For lung
metastasis treatment, the treated mice (n = 5) were euthanatized on the 21st day by
carbon dioxide asphyxiation and collected their lungs. The number of metastatic
nodules in the lungs and the lung weight was recorded. The lung slices were then
stained with H&E to observe the metastasis foci.
For ﬂow cytometry analysis of immune cells in spleen and distant tumor, the
spleens and distant tumors were collected at seven days after treatments and cut
into small pieces, then the tissues were digested with collagenase V (2 mg/ml,
YEASEN) in HBSS solution for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were ﬁltered through 70 μm cell
strainer to obtain single cell suspension, and then analyzed by ﬂow cytometer as
stated above.
Biosafety assay. Blood routine indexes, blood biochemical indexes and H&E
staining of organs were used to evaluate the biosafety of URB. The tumor-bearing
mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 3) including control group, US
group, E.coli group, URB group, E.coli + US group and URB + US group. The
treated mice were sacriﬁced seven days after ultrasound irradiation. Blood samples
were collected by eyeball extirpating. The organs were collected to perform H&E
staining.
Statistical analysis. All data were presented as mean ± SD. Independent T test was
used for two groups compared. One-way ANOVA using the Tukey post-test for
more than two groups compared. All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS
26.0. The results were signiﬁcant when ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05.
